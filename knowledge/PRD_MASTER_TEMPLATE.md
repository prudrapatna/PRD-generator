## 4. MARKET POSITIONING: THE PERSONAL HEALTH ASSISTANT (9 THINGS)
*(Sample Reference from Project Salus - Loss of Pulse Detection)*

| Item | Title | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Loss of Pulse Detection** | Loss of Pulse Detection is a first-to-market smartwatch feature intended to detect pulselessness arising from a number of causes, including but not limited to conditions like cardiac arrest, poisoning, or respiratory arrest. When every minute matters, the Loss of Pulse Detection feature on the Pixel Watch 3 can detect a loss of pulse event and prompt a call to lifesaving emergency services. |
| **2** | **Loss of Pulse event significance** | Unanticipated loss of pulse events are time-sensitive emergencies requiring immediate intervention. When a loss of pulse event happens, it’s usually up to a bystander to give or get help. However, half of all loss of pulse events related to cardiac arrest, for example, are unwitnessed – leaving millions worldwide effectively no chance of receiving emergency care soon after losing their pulse. |
| **3** | **A first-of-its-kind feature** | Loss of Pulse Detection can detect a pulselessness event and help place an automatic call to emergency services even in unwitnessed cases, enabling access to lifesaving care from emergency medical responders, a first-of-its-kind software feature in the smartwatch market. It underwent rigorous validation in lab and clinical environments to ensure accuracy. |
| **4** | **How Loss of Pulse Detection works** | The AI-based algorithm uses the Pixel Watch 3’s multi-path heart rate sensor. If signs of pulselessness are detected, Pixel Watch 3 activates additional sensors’ signals to identify any pulse or motion. If no signs of pulse or motion are detected, it begins an initial check-in. If you don’t respond, it will start to play a loud sound and escalate to a countdown before calling emergency services. |
| **5** | **Rigorous testing approach and validation** | Google took a rigorous testing approach and obtained regulatory clearance. Researchers used a tourniquet to artificially induce peripheral pulselessness and showed that a watch can detect it. Further, people with procedures requiring induced ventricular fibrillation wore a watch to evaluate algorithms in real-world loss of pulse events. |
| **6** | **AI in Loss of Pulse Detection** | Loss of Pulse Detection uses a multi-check, AI-powered algorithm to identify loss of pulse and minimize accidental triggers. The machine learning–based algorithm uses the multi-path heart rate sensor to detect signs of pulselessness and prompt a call to emergency services if needed. |
| **7** | **Launch markets** | The initial rollout includes support for 15+ countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and USA. |
| **8** | **Enhanced peace of mind with the Pixel Watch 3** | Loss of Pulse Detection joins features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, Safety Check, and Fall Detection to help users stay safe and connected. Whether helping you share heart data with your doctor, or allowing you to easily notify your contacts if you feel unsafe, the Pixel Watch 3 helps you feel more confident. |
| **9** | **Loss of Pulse Detection partners** | Google worked with partners like cardiologists, global authorities on resuscitation, and Emergency Medical Service leaders, dispatchers, and paramedics to get their feedback on the technology. Their partnership has further validated the positive impact that this feature may have worldwide. |

### Consumer Interest
*   **WTP:** [WTP and preference data from Conjoint reports.]

### Disclaimers
*   **US Disclaimer:** Loss of Pulse Detection may not detect every instance of a loss of pulse and is not intended for users with preexisting heart conditions or those who require cardiac monitoring. It does not diagnose or treat any medical condition or provide follow-up care. Emergency calling is dependent on call functionality such as your phone or watch being charged and having adequate cellular connectivity.
*   **EMEA Disclaimer:** Loss of Pulse Detection may not detect every instance of a loss of pulse and is not intended for users with preexisting heart conditions or those who require cardiac monitoring. It does not diagnose or treat any medical condition or provide follow-up care. CE marked - Will be made available in select markets by September 2024.
