**Current Direction:**
Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) vs. General Wellness (Exploring both paths, preference for wellness).

**General Wellness Path (Current Hypothesis):**
*   **Intent:** Promote blood pressure awareness and engage users in coaching.
*   **Restrictions:**
    *   **NO:** Directly tell the user they are at risk of hypertension (chronic medical condition).
    *   **NO:** Make medical diagnoses or recommendations.
    *   **YES:** Highlight blood pressure estimates / trends.
    *   **YES:** Provide in range / out of range insights.
    *   **YES:** Nudge users that consulting a healthcare expert might be helpful.

**Key Constraints:**
*   Must clearly distinguish between "medical diagnosis" and "educational insights."
*   Any language implying medical capability (e.g., "Monitor", "Diagnose") is strictly prohibited unless following SaMD pathway.
