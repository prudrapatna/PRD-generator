# Product Strategy: Tidal

**Current Context:**
We are at a pivotal decision point: choosing between a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) approach (medically regulated) and a Wellness approach (General Wellness).

**Strategic Approach:**
*   **The Wellness Path (Preferred):** Promote blood pressure awareness and engage users in coaching *without* being a diagnostic medical device.
*   **Key Decision Support:** We are actively studying the barriers and drivers to actionability and credibility for 2 wellness proposals and 1 SaMD proposal.

**Differentiation:**
*   **Actionability Focus:** Unlike competitors focused solely on data logging, we aim to drive action: doctor visits, lifestyle changes, and cuff validation.
*   **Credibility Focus:** We are exploring the impact of FDA clearance, published studies, and transparency about inputs (what data is used) on user trust.

**Target Outcomes:**
*   Identify barriers to actionability (why don't people see a doctor?).
*   Identify drivers of credibility (do clinical experts matter?).
