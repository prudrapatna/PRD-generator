# Deliverable: 9 Things About Blood Pressure Trends
**Project Tidal: The Cardiovascular Guardian for Pixel Watch 3 & Fitbit**

### 1. Blood Pressure Trends Overview
Blood Pressure Trends is a breakthrough general wellness feature for Pixel Watch and Fitbit devices designed to bring invisible cardiovascular signals into everyday awareness. By quietly working in the background, it estimates long-term blood pressure patterns across daily life and sleep, transforming a device people already wear into a tool for proactive health management.

### 2. The Significance of the "Silent Killer"
High blood pressure is the #1 risk factor for cardiovascular death worldwide, yet approximately 50% of adults—including those in the 18-44 age bracket—are unaware when their levels move outside of a healthy range. Because high blood pressure is fundamentally asymptomatic, users lack the urgency to check it. Blood Pressure Trends bridges this "awareness gap" by identifying sustained patterns that a single, isolated cuff reading might miss.

### 3. A First-of-its-Kind Wellness Feature
This is a first-to-market, calibration-free system that closes the loop between pattern identification and lifestyle guidance. Unlike traditional monitoring that requires a manual cuff or monthly calibrations, Blood Pressure Trends is a passive, opportunistic assessment tool. It defines a new category: the **Personal Health Agent for Cardiovascular Wellness**, focusing on longitudinal intelligence rather than reactive data points.

### 4. How Blood Pressure Trends Works
The feature leverages a multi-check, AI-powered algorithm using the device's PPG (optical heart rate) and accelerometer sensors. Over a full calendar month, the system analyzes physiological data during both daily activity and sleep (where "nocturnal dipping" patterns provide critical health context). If signs of out-of-range patterns are detected, the system aggregates 14 days of data to confirm a sustained trend before delivering a calm, context-rich notification to the user.

### 5. Rigorous Testing and Clinical Validation
To responsibly develop Blood Pressure Trends, Google utilized **WavesFM**, a foundation model pretrained on a massive dataset of **400,000 individuals (1.3M sensor hours)**. The algorithm underwent rigorous validation in the **Tidal Clinical** and **Tidal Preval** studies, involving 450+ participants. It was tested against the "gold standard" ground truth: **24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)**. In clinical testing, the algorithm achieved a specificity of over 92%, proving it is as reliable as a professional office check while providing 24/7 coverage.

### 6. AI in Blood Pressure Trends
The feature uses a multimodal, multiscale foundation model (**WavesFM**) that interprets the "shape" of the blood pulse. This machine-learning-based architecture is designed to minimize false alarms by distinguishing between temporary stress spikes and sustained cardiovascular shifts. It doesn't just look at heart rate; it analyzes the complex morphology of the PPG waveform to estimate the pressure patterns beneath the skin.

### 7. Global Launch Markets
The rollout of Blood Pressure Trends is planned for **50+ countries**, providing global access to cardiovascular awareness. Supported markets include:
- **North America:** United States, Canada.
- **Asia-Pacific:** Japan, Australia, New Zealand.
- **Europe:** 20+ member countries including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands.
*Note: This feature is intended for general wellness and is currently cleared for launch in markets where cardiovascular wellness tools do not require medical device registration.*

### 8. Enhanced Peace of Mind with the Personal Health Assistant
Blood Pressure Trends joins a suite of proactive safety and health features—including irregular heart rhythm notifications, Fall Detection, and Safety Check—to bring users peace of mind. By correlating blood pressure shifts with sleep and activity patterns, the Google Personal Health Assistant helps users understand the *why* behind their health data, encouraging them to speak with healthcare providers for proper evaluation when it matters most.

### 9. Expert Partners and Clinical Leadership
In bringing this technology to market, Google worked with leading cardiologists and clinical researchers, including Dr. Stephen Juraschek, to ensure the insights provided are clinically grounded. These partnerships further validate the positive impact that passive trend detection can have on supporting healthier lifestyle decisions and improving overall cardiovascular outcomes.
