# Metabolic Health: General Wellness Proposal

## Summary
We are proposing a general wellness product pathway for a metabolic health indicator (as Insulin Resistance or Metabolic Efficiency) based on the FDA guidance **“General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices” - Jan 2026**. This offers an opportunity to be first in the market.

## Key Questions
- Regulatory constraints for framing as “Insulin Resistance Status” vs “Metabolic Efficiency Status”?
- Is a 513(g) required or is internal determination sufficient?
- Which positioning enables a faster path to market?

## Intended Use
The feature is a software application intended to provide healthy users insights into their glucose management and associated metabolic efficiency during rest and exercise.

**Constraints:**
- Not intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent any disease.
- Not a substitute for professional medical advice.
- **Contraindications:** Prediabetes, Diabetes, Pregnancy, 6 months post-partum.

## User Experience
- **Positioning:** Think of insulin resistance as your body’s "fuel efficiency."
- **Status Indicators:** 
  - High or Low Status
  - Incomplete data indicator (weight stale)
  - Not available indicator (contraindications)
  - Calculation in progress indicator
- **Lifestyle Guidance:** Focus on activity, diet, stress management, sleep, muscle building, and weight loss.

## Regulatory Assessment

### US (FDA)
Meets the definition of a general wellness product because it:
- Is non-invasive and not implanted.
- Does not pose a safety risk.
- Is not intended for diagnosis/treatment.
- Does not guide specific clinical action.
- Uses non-invasive sensing (optical) which is lower risk than existing glucose monitoring examples (microneedles).

### EU (MDR)
- If a state is considered "well-being" (fitness/stress), it is not a medical device.
- "Insulin resistance" is a recognized physiological dysfunction and sits in the "pathological" category.
- **Recommendation:** Target "healthy individuals" to maintain the wellness/lifestyle category. Explicitly state the product is not for individuals with metabolic disorders.

## Labeling Cautions
To maintain wellness positioning, do **NOT** include:
- References to screening/managing diabetes/prediabetes.
- Labeling glucose as “abnormal.”
- Prompts to see a medical professional based on specific thresholds.
- Claims of real-time glucose tracking.

## Justification
- >40% of US adults have insulin resistance with low awareness.
- Consumers show high interest (79%) and willingness to pay.
- Driving interest in downstream features like CGM (56-59% interested).
