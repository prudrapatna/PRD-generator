# Decision Document: Product Output Naming

## Decision
We will move forward with **"Insulin Resistance Level"** as the primary product output name. 

## Narrative Framework
To ensure high user engagement and long-term retention, the narrative framework will be rooted in **Metabolic Efficiency**.

## Rationale
- **Consumer Trust:** Drives trust in preventive health coaching (top 5 PHA value driver, $1.15 value attribution).
- **Adoption:** Encourages adoption of downstream features (e.g., CGM interest at 59%).
- **Compliance:** Compatible with FDA General Wellness Guidance.
- **Scientific Credibility:** Insulin resistance framing has high credibility, while the metabolic efficiency explanation meets user needs (75% meeting need, 86% fit with PHA).
