Top OKRs and health vision



DRIs: andya@

--- Slide 46 ---

In 2025, we took the first step towards our long term vision



--- Slide 47 ---

And with this, we have started changing the narrative


From this…



--- Slide 48 ---

Initial reception of preview has been cautiously optimistic











Fitbit’s AI health coach is the first I might actually be interested in













“If Google gets this right – simple, long battery life, plus some smart AI coaching – Fitbit could totally own that space again.””









“The redesign and Coach feature show serious potential. If it delivers on Google’s promises of bringing professional-grade coaching to mainstream users, it could mark a turning point for wellness tech and could position Google at the front of the pack.”


“That's what makes the new Fitbit Personal Health Coach more useful than other LLMs: The relevance to your personal circumstances. You can ask it to summarize what it knows about you and get a massive text dump of information...”


“Fitbit finally wakes up from its nap - 

and it’s bringing AI coffee”




Fitbit AI Coach: The LLM Shift That Leaves Garmin and Strava Behind



--- Slide 49 ---

…and while many users see the promise









 

“I love the interaction with the AI coach!!  I am gaining valuable insight into my health and fitness and how to maintain it.  The insight into the data and its interpretation has been especially valuable in just the first day.  I look forward to more.” 






“...it asked me to do A HUNDRED PLUS ‘bent over rows’?? In what way is it practical to do that?”


“I just finished my workout so it gave me details on how I just did and explained how well I did my intervals and so forth. I'm loving it.” - Reddit user


“I am truly loving this app now!!!!  Keep up the great work.  now if you all can just allow 2 devices to be switched out without losing steps that would be AWESOME!  


“Stop the AI flattery - I know when i've done good and I know when I haven't”


“After all the criticism of jumpy daily target loads, Fitbit is officially replacing it with more stable weekly target loads!” 

“I dug out the Charge 6 and am charging it.”  - Reddit users


Others remind us: This is just the beginning


“absolutely loving this new app experience. I feel like everything is much better laid out and easier to understand. so far Gemini is an excellent help for the coach as well”


“I want my stats at the top, not some wall of text that tells me the same stuff I already know.”


“I like the old version.”


“it seems like the coach can't connect my plan to activities that are logged “



--- Slide 50 ---

And there are a lot of missing features to finish

Types: VO2Max, Heart Rate zones


Social, Kids, Sharing

Logging, Manual editing

Badges

📉 Missing Data


🚧 Missing Features


🌐 Scale/expansion


⚠️ Limitations



--- Slide 51 ---

But, the (super) early metrics are showing positive signs 



--- Slide 52 ---

What we’ve learned so far from users and press…


📈  Expectations are high — but we are on the right track


🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Need to support all personas + incorporate 3P data


🚧 Fitness “plan” flexibility is key… and not there yet


🤩 Excitement for new HW is there


⚠️  Missing features/data, readiness/sleep algo quality, verbosity 





--- Slide 53 ---

While this was a big milestone,

our big moment is next year



--- Slide 54 ---

Because we are at a key inflection point


Heating up competition in Health + AI



Strong interest across the company



Changing tides in governments could be an unlock



Rebrand to “Google Health” is a big statement from Google



High expectations






Why?
