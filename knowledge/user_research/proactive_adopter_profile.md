## 6. Strategic Messaging (Resonance)
To win this segment, messaging must focus on:
1.  **Simplification:** "Your Health Journey, Simplified." (Highest resonance with **Proactive Adopters, 18-34 yo, Women**).
2.  **Progress:** "Your Progress. Unlocked by a Coach That Truly Knows You." (Resonates with **Advanced H&F consumers**; Highest WTP).
3.  **Consistency:** "Build Habits That Stick." (Best opportunity to **retain/upgrade Fitbit Owners**).

## 7. Strategic Implications
*   **Broad Impact:** By focusing on Proactive Adopters, we address **51% of the general population's needs**.
*   **Engagement:** Their high activity level and trust make them the ideal "power user" base.
*   **Design Principle:** Design for the "Regular" profile (consistency/balance) but ensure "Seeker" (weight loss) and "Enthusiast" (performance) needs are met as scalable extensions.
