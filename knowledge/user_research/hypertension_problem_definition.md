# User Research: The Hidden Hypertension Problem

**Source:** Tidal Project Deck (Slide 8)
**Context:** Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) is a silent crisis, particularly for younger adults who are often overlooked by traditional screening.

## 1. The Scale of the Problem
*   **Prevalence:** Approximately **50% of Americans** have hypertension.
*   **The Silent Majority:** Among those with *uncontrolled* hypertension, **~50% (approx. 60 million adults)** are completely unaware of their condition.
*   **The Youth Gap:** The awareness gap is significantly worse for younger adults (aged 18-44). In this group, **~70% (~20 million)** with uncontrolled hypertension do not know they have it.

## 2. Why Current Solutions Fail
*   **Lack of Symptoms:** High blood pressure is asymptomatic ("The Silent Killer"). People don't feel it until a major health event occurs.
*   **Screening Friction:** Diagnosis relies on:
    *   **Office Visits:** Infrequent (annual at best), prone to "White Coat Hypertension."
    *   **Home/Ambulatory Monitoring:** Requires dedicated hardware (cuffs) and active user effort (2x/day for 5-7 days).
*   **The Result:** Most people, especially the "invincible" young demographic, simply don't check.

## 3. The Opportunity (Project Tidal)
*   **Goal:** Move from active, infrequent screening to **passive, recurring detection**.
*   **Mechanism:** Use wrist-worn wearables (PPG sensors) to detect *signs* of persistent hypertension in the background.
*   **Impact:** Bridge the awareness gap for the 20 million young adults who are currently flying blind, enabling early intervention and longevity.
