## 2. PORTFOLIO SHARE OF PREFERENCE (SOP)
### Pixel Watch SOP (Among Pixel Phone Owners)
*   **Total:** ~30-37% preference across regions.

### N-1 Strategy Impact (Removing PW3/PW2 models)

## 5. HARDWARE ATTRIBUTE DEEP DIVE
### Housing Material
*   **Aluminum:** Most preferred/value-aligned material overall.
*   **Titanium:** Increases SOP slightly (+0.4% in US) but pulls primarily from Samsung/Apple premium segments.
*   **Women (18-24):** Show higher interest in Titanium materials than the general population.

### Processing Power
*   **Premium:** Sufficient for most.
*   **Ultra Premium + Memory:** Does NOT meaningfully drive preference share increase for most, but is a "table stakes" expectation for Technophiles.

### GPS & Connectivity
*   **Advanced GPS:** Slight preference across all segments (+0.2-0.5%).
*   **LTE + Satellite:** Highly preferred for "Peace of Mind" safety positioning.

## 6. BATTERY LIFE THRESHOLDS
*   **Target:** 3-5 days is the "magic" threshold for a double-digit jump in interest from Garmin owners.
*   **WTP for Battery (US):** Users are willing to pay ~$100 for a jump from 2 days to 3 days of battery life.
*   **12-Hour Increments:** For the 45mm (Kenari) size, users value 12-hour jumps significantly more than 41mm users.
