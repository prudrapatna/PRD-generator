# User Research: Tidal Generative Study

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Owner:** Jeremy Schwark (jeremyschwark@)
**Method:** Unmoderated Survey (n=328, Android users)
**Audience:**
*   **Sample Size:** 328 Android users (External).
*   **Condition Status:** Includes Pre-existing conditions (Hypertension, High Cholesterol, Asthma, Tachycardia, Pre-diabetes).
*   **Top User Goals:** Manage health condition, Lose weight, Monitor overall health.

## 1. User Segmentation & Current Habits

### Knowledge & Familiarity
*   **BP Awareness:** Most users are somewhat or very familiar with blood pressure concepts.
*   **Confidence:** High confidence in knowing their own typical BP numbers (likely due to frequent measurement).
*   **Hypertension Awareness:**
    *   Most participants correctly identified common hypertension symptoms.
    *   Many could estimate Stage 1 hypertension cutoffs.
    *   **Perceived Risk:** Most rated their personal risk as "Moderate."

### Measurement Behavior
*   **Prevalence:** >75% of participants have measured their own BP.
    *   **Chronic Strugglers:** 86% measure their own BP.
    *   **Proactive Adopters / Anxious Evaluators:** 75% measure their own BP.
*   **Methods:** Automatic upper arm monitors (most common) and wearables.
*   **Ownership:** Most who measure own a standalone BP monitor (especially Chronic Strugglers & Proactive Adopters).
*   **Frequency:** >50% of those who measure do so at least **weekly**.
*   **Action Taken:** Most self-monitor; some share with HCP; a few report **adjusting medications on their own** (Risk!).

### Wearable Usage
*   **Adoption:** High familiarity with wearables.
*   **Current Monitoring:** Many claim to monitor conditions (BP, SpO2) that their device likely *cannot* do, suggesting a placebo effect or confusion with other metrics (Heart Rate).

## 2. Feature Concept Testing

**Concept:** "A new feature that passively checks for signs of high blood pressure while you’re wearing the device. It would send you an alert if it detected high blood pressure, which could be a sign that you have hypertension."

### Appeal & Interest
*   **Likelihood to Enable:** **94% Total** (65% Very Likely, 29% Somewhat Likely).
*   **Utility:** **93%** felt it would be somewhat/very useful.
*   **Recommendation Score:** >80% would recommend it to a friend/family member.
*   **Purchase Influence:** Majority said this feature would **increase likelihood** of buying a wearable (for self or family).

### Why People Want It (Pros)
1.  **Effortless / Automatic:** "Set it and forget it." Removes burden of manual checks.
2.  **Proactive / Early Detection:** Catching the "Silent Killer" before symptoms appear.
3.  **Safety Net:** "It can save my life." Persistent sense of safety.
4.  **Management:** For those with known risks, it's a tool for ongoing management.

### Why People Worry (Cons)
1.  **Accuracy / Reliability:** Skepticism that a watch matches a cuff. "It's never right." Fear of false warnings.
2.  **Alert Anxiety:** Fear that frequent/false alerts will cause stress (spiking BP further). "Just wearing it would raise my BP."
3.  **Data Privacy:** Fear of data sharing with advertisers/companies. "Constant recording of my private health."

## 3. Functionality Preferences & Expectations

### Important Aspects (Top 3)
1.  **Accuracy:** "I want it to accurately do what it says it will (detect hypertension)."
2.  **Actionability:** "I want to understand what the feature is telling me and what to do about it."
3.  **HCP Sharing:** "I want to share data with an HCP."

### Next Steps Desired
*   **Top Requests:**
    *   Share data with HCP directly from app.
    *   Follow-up check-ins/insights.
    *   Info on lifestyle changes to reduce BP.

### Notification Dynamics
*   **Reminder Frequency:**
    *   **Unviewed Result:** Users want **Daily Reminders**.
    *   **Dismissed (But Still High):** Users want **Daily Re-alerts**.
*   **Action Threshold:**
    *   **76%** would need **multiple notifications** before calling a doctor.
    *   Many would interpret 1 notification = 1 high reading (not a persistent state).
*   **Response to "Ignored" Alerts:**
    *   If alerts continue, most would:
        1.  Take a manual BP measurement (Validation).
        2.  Follow up with HCP.
        3.  Wait for symptoms (Minority).
*   **Emergency Response:** Most would **not** call 911, but a small subset might consider it.

### False Alarm Tolerance
*   **Sensitivity:** Extremely High.
*   **Churn Risk:** Over **50%** would consider turning off the feature after receiving just **1-2 false alarms in a year**.

## 4. Strategic Implications (Key Takeaways)

1.  **Misconception Management:** Users will likely think this is a *continuous* monitor (real-time). We must clarify it is a *passive spot-checker* to manage expectations.
2.  **The "Validation" Loop:** Users *will* validate with a home cuff immediately. The app should lean into this behavior rather than ignore it.
    *   *Risk:* Users adjusting meds based on watch data alone.
3.  **The "Boy Who Cried Wolf":** High sensitivity to false alarms means we must prioritize **Precision over Recall**.
4.  **Messaging Urgency:** Users may ignore a single notification. Messaging must clarify that **One Alert = Multiple Detections**, warranting immediate attention.
5.  **HCP Integration:** The ability to share/export results is a critical feature, not a "nice-to-have."
6.  **Onboarding:** Must proactively address Accuracy, Anxiety, and Privacy to convert the "skeptics."
