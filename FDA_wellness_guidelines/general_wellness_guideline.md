On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation  in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is  now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality  management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard  specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO  13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,  providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to  consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with  the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). 
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages  manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory  requirements.

General Wellness:  
Policy for Low Risk Devices 
Guidance for Industry and  
Food and Drug Administration Staff 
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or  Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or  the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable  statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office  responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.
I. Introduction 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this guidance document to provide  clarity to industry and FDA staff on the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s  (CDRH’s) compliance policy for low risk products that promote a healthy lifestyle (general  wellness products).1 This guidance does not apply to products (e.g., drugs, biologics, dietary  supplements, foods, or cosmetics) regulated by other FDA Centers or to combination  products.2 
Section 3060(a) of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) amended section 520 of the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) on December 13, 2016, removing  certain software functions, including those intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy  lifestyle that are unrelated to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, prevention, or treatment of a  disease or condition, from the definition of device in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act. Section 520(o)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, states that software that is intended “for maintaining  or encouraging a healthy lifestyle and is unrelated to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,  prevention, or treatment of a disease or condition” is not a device under section 201(h) of the  FD&C Act. 
1 This guidance does not change or rescind any requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  (FD&C Act) or any applicable regulations. This guidance also does not preclude FDA from consulting with the  Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) as to whether a general wellness product is a consumer product  under CPSC’s authority or a device. FDA may coordinate with other agencies and authorities, such as the  CPSC, to determine jurisdiction over products. If a product is a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, it  is generally excluded from CPSC’s authority over “consumer products” under the Consumer Product Safety Act  (15 U.S.C. § 2052(a)(5)(ii)(H)). However, CPSC and FDA may both have jurisdiction over certain medical  devices under other statutory authorities the CPSC administers. 
2 For determinations on combination products, contact the Office of Combination Products at  combination@fda.gov. See 21 CFR 3.2(e) for the definition of a combination product.

This guidance clarifies FDA’s interpretation of this provision and its application to general  wellness products. 
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable  responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and  should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory  requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that  something is suggested or recommended, but not required. 
II. Policy on Low Risk General Wellness Products 
CDRH does not intend to examine low risk general wellness products to determine whether  they are devices3 within the meaning of the FD&C Act or, if they are devices, whether they  comply with the premarket review and post-market regulatory requirements for devices under the FD&C Act and implementing regulations, including, but not limited to: registration  and listing and premarket notification requirements (21 CFR Part 807); labeling requirements  (21 CFR Part 801 and 21 CFR 809.10); good manufacturing practice requirements as set  forth in 21 CFR Part 820 (referred to as the Quality System regulation prior to February 2,  2026 and the Quality Management System Regulation starting February 2, 2026); and  Medical Device Reporting (MDR) requirements (21 CFR Part 803). 
For purposes of this guidance, CDRH defines general wellness products as products that  meet the following two factors: (1) are intended for only general wellness use, as defined in  this guidance, and (2) present a low risk to the safety of users and other persons. General  wellness products may include exercise equipment, audio recordings, video games, software  programs4 and other products that are commonly, though not exclusively, available from  retail establishments (including online retailers and distributors that offer software to be  directly downloaded), when consistent with the two factors above. 
CDRH regularly receives inquiries about whether particular products are devices as defined  by the FD&C Act. There are instances where certain general wellness products, as discussed  in this guidance, do not meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C  Act and therefore are not subject to the FD&C Act’s regulatory requirements for devices. Additionally, section 520(o)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act excludes software functions that are  intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle and are unrelated to the diagnosis,  cure, mitigation, prevention, or treatment of a disease or condition from the definition of 
3 The term “device” is defined in 201(h) of the FD&C Act to include an “instrument, apparatus, implement,  machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component,  part, or accessory, which is …intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure,  mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man … or intended to affect the structure or any function of  
the body of man...” and “does not include software functions excluded pursuant to section 520(o) of the FD&C  Act.” 
4 For more discussion regarding FDA’s regulatory approach towards certain device software functions and  mobile medical applications, see the FDA Guidance: Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical  Applications, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/policy device-software-functions-and-mobile-medical-applications.

device in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act .5 We have included examples of products below  that meet the definition of general wellness products to help illustrate the concepts in the  guidance. 
A product's inclusion under the general wellness policy in this guidance does not establish  that it has been shown to be safe and/or effective for its intended use.  
III. General Wellness Products 
A general wellness product, for the purposes of this guidance, has (1) an intended use that  relates to maintaining or encouraging a general state of health or a healthy activity, or (2) an  intended use that relates the role of healthy lifestyle with helping to reduce the risk or impact  
of certain chronic diseases or conditions and where it is well understood and accepted that  healthy lifestyle choices may play an important role in health outcomes for the disease or  condition. 
If the product’s intended uses are not limited to the above general wellness intended uses,  this guidance does not apply.  
The first category of general wellness intended uses involve claims about sustaining or  offering general improvement to functions associated with a general state of health that do not make any reference to diseases or conditions. For the purposes of this guidance, this  first category of general wellness claims relate to: 
• weight management, 
• physical fitness, including products intended for recreational use, 
• relaxation or stress management, 
• mental acuity, 
• self-esteem (e.g., devices with a cosmetic function that make claims related only to  self-esteem), 
• sleep management, or 
• sexual function. 
The following are examples of this category of general wellness claims: 
• Claims to promote or maintain a healthy weight, encourage healthy eating, or assist  with weight loss goals;  
• Claims to promote relaxation or manage stress; 
• Claims to increase, improve, or enhance the flow of qi “energy”; 
• Claims to improve mental acuity, instruction following, concentration, problem solving, multitasking, resource management, decision-making, logic, pattern  recognition, or eye-hand coordination; 
5 “Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting the authority of the [FDA] to— (A) exercise  enforcement discretion as to any device subject to regulation under this Act . . .” (section 520(o)(4) of the  FD&C Act).

• Claims to enhance learning capacity; 
• Claims to promote physical fitness, such as to help log, track, or trend exercise  activity, measure aerobic fitness, improve physical fitness, develop or improve  endurance, strength or coordination, or improve energy (e.g., “fitness” or “activity”  trackers); 
• Claims to promote sleep management, such as to track sleep trends; • Claims to promote self-esteem, such as to boost self-esteem; 
• Claims that address a specific body structure or function, such as to increase or  improve muscle size or body tone, tone or firm the body or muscle, or enhance or  improve sexual performance; 
• Claims to improve general mobility or to assist individuals who are mobility impaired  in a recreational activity (e.g., sport wheelchairs, beach access wheelchairs); and • Claims to enhance an individual’s participation in recreational activities by  monitoring the consequences of participating in such activities, such as to monitor  heart rate or monitor frequency or impact of collisions. 
The following are examples of claims that do not fall into this category of general wellness  claims: 
• A claim that a product will treat or diagnose obesity; 
• A claim that a product will treat an eating disorder, such as anorexia; • A claim that a product helps treat an anxiety disorder; 
• A claim that a computer game will diagnose or treat autism; 
• A claim that a product will treat muscle atrophy or erectile dysfunction; and • A claim to restore a structure or function impaired due to a disease or condition, e.g.,  a claim that a prosthetic device enables amputees to walk.6 
The second category of general wellness intended uses relate to sustaining or offering general  improvement to functions associated with a general state of health while making reference to diseases or conditions. For the purposes of this guidance, this second category of general  wellness claims is comprised of two subcategories: 
1) intended uses to promote, track, and/or encourage choice(s), which, as part of a  healthy lifestyle, may help to reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases or  conditions; and 
2) intended uses to promote, track, and/or encourage choice(s) which, as part of a  healthy lifestyle, may help living well with certain chronic diseases or conditions. 
Both subcategories of disease-related general wellness claims should only be based on  references where it is well understood that healthy lifestyle choices may reduce the risk or 
6 Products intended to restore a structure or function impaired due to a disease might be regulated by FDA as  devices. For example, an artificial limb prosthesis intended to provide disabled persons the ability to walk might  be regulated under 21 CFR 890.3420 or 21 CFR 890.3500.

impact of a chronic disease or medical condition. That is, the claim that the healthy lifestyle  choice(s) may play an important role in health outcomes should be generally accepted; such  associations are described in peer-reviewed scientific publications or official statements  made by healthcare professional organizations.7 Examples of chronic diseases for which a  healthy lifestyle is associated with risk reduction or help in living well with that disease  include heart disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes. 
The following are examples of this category of disease-related general wellness claims: 
• Software Product U coaches breathing techniques and relaxation skills, which, as part  of a healthy lifestyle, may help living well with migraine headaches. 
• Software Product V tracks and records your sleep, work and exercise routine which,  as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help living well with anxiety. 
• Product W promotes making healthy lifestyle choices such as getting enough sleep,  eating a balanced diet, and maintaining a healthy weight, which may help living well  with type 2 diabetes. 
• Product X promotes physical activity, which, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help  reduce the risk of high blood pressure. 
• Software Product Y tracks your caloric intake and helps you manage a healthy eating  plan to maintain a healthy weight and balanced diet. Healthy weight and balanced diet  may help living well with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. 
• Product Z tracks activity sleep patterns and promotes healthy sleep habits, which, as  part of a healthy lifestyle, may help reduce the risk for developing type 2 diabetes. 
FDA may consider certain products that use non-invasive sensing (e.g. optical sensing) to  estimate, infer, or output physiologic parameters (e.g. blood pressure, oxygen saturation, blood  glucose, heart rate variability) to be general wellness products when such outputs are intended  solely for wellness uses, and provided they: 
• are non-invasive and not-implanted; 
• do not involve an intervention or technology that may pose a risk to the safety of users  or other persons if specific regulatory controls are not applied;  
• are not intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, prevention, or treatment of a  disease or condition; 
• are not intended to substitute for an FDA-authorized, cleared, or approved device;  
• do not include claims, functionality, or outputs that prompt or guide specific clinical  action or medical management; and 
• do not include values that mimic those used clinically unless validated (e.g.  manufacturer testing, peer-reviewed clinical literature) to reflect those values. 
7 By organizations we mean associations and colleges such as American Medical Association (AMA),  American Heart Association (AHA), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), American  College of Rheumatology, etc.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
Products that meet the aforementioned criteria may display values, ranges, trends, baselines,  or longitudinal summaries, and may contextualize these outputs in relation to sleep, activity,  stress, recovery, or similar wellness domains.  
Products are not general wellness products when they are intended to measure, estimate, or  report physiologic values for medical or clinical purposes, including screening, diagnosis,  monitoring, alerting, or management of a disease or condition.  
Examples of such products include but are not limited to: blood pressure monitors or  sphygmomanometers, blood glucose measuring devices such as fingerstick blood glucose  meters and continuous glucose monitoring systems, electrocardiogram recording and analysis  devices, and any product that is intended to provide outputs used to make treatment decisions  (e.g., medication dosing).  
Products are not general wellness products if their labeling, advertising, user interface, or  functionality includes any of the following: 1. references to specific diseases, clinical  conditions, or diagnostic thresholds; 2. alerts, alarms, or prompts that recommend or require  specific clinical action or medical management; 3. treatment guidance intended to inform or  direct medical management; 4. claims of clinical equivalence, clinical accuracy, medical or  clinical grade, or substitution for an FDA-authorized, cleared, or approved medical device; or  5. intended-use statements that explicitly target diagnosis, screening, monitoring, or  management of a disease or condition.  
For purposes of this guidance, a product may be considered a general wellness product even if it includes a notification informing a user that evaluation by a healthcare professional may be  helpful when outputs fall outside ranges appropriate for general wellness use, provided that  such notifications: 
• do not identify or name a specific disease or medical condition;  
• do not characterize the output as abnormal, pathological, or diagnostic; • do not include clinical thresholds, diagnoses, or treatment recommendations; and  • do not provide ongoing alerts or monitoring intended to manage a disease or condition.  
FDA expects that a product intended for general wellness use will have labeling (including  instructions for use, user-facing claims, promotional materials, and marketing  communications) that is consistent with, and does not exceed, the product’s stated intended  use. 
IV. Determining Risk for General Wellness Products 
CDRH’s general wellness policy applies only to general wellness products that are low risk.8 If the answer to any of the following questions is YES, the product is not low risk and is not  covered by this guidance. 
1) Is the product invasive9? 
8 Whether a device is classified as class I under section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act does not necessarily mean  that it is “low risk” for purposes of this guidance. 
9 For purposes of this guidance, “invasive” means penetrates or pierces the skin or mucous membranes of the  body.
6 
Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
2) Is the product implanted? 
3) Does the product involve an intervention or technology that may pose a risk to the  safety of users and other persons if specific regulatory controls are not applied, such  as risks from lasers or radiation exposure? 
In assessing whether a product is low risk for purposes of this guidance, FDA recommends  that you also consider whether CDRH actively regulates products of the same type as the  product in question. For example, CDRH actively regulates external penile rigidity devices,  which are devices intended to create or maintain sufficient penile rigidity for sexual  intercourse, under 21 CFR 876.5020 as class II devices exempt from premarket notification  with special controls. The special controls for these devices address risks to health that are  associated with the use of these devices, including, without limitation, tissue injury, trauma  or infection.10 Therefore, these types of devices would not be considered low risk general  wellness products. 
The following are examples of products that would not be considered “low risk” as described  in this guidance: 
• Sunlamp products promoted for tanning purposes, due to risks to a user’s safety from  the ultraviolet radiation, including, without limitation, an increased risk of skin  cancer.11 
• Implants promoted for improved self-image or enhanced sexual function. Implants  pose risks to users such as rupture or adverse reaction to implant materials and risks  associated with the implantation procedure. 
• A laser product that claims to improve confidence in user’s appearance by  rejuvenating the skin. Although the claims of rejuvenating the skin and improving  confidence in user’s appearance are general wellness claims, laser technology  presents risks of skin and eye burns. 
• A neurostimulation product that claims to improve memory, due to the risks to a  user’s safety from electrical stimulation. 
• A product that claims to enhance a user’s athletic performance by providing  suggestions based on the results of relative lactic acid testing, when the product uses  venipuncture to obtain the blood samples needed for testing. Such a product is not  low risk because it is invasive (e.g., obtains blood samples by piercing the skin) and  also because the product involves an intervention that may pose a risk to the safety of  the user and other persons if specific regulatory controls are not applied (e.g.,  venipuncture may pose a risk of infection transmission).

V. Examples of General Wellness Products that Are Not  Medical Devices and Examples of General Wellness  Products that Are Medical Devices for which FDA Does  Not Intend to Enforce Requirements 
Illustrative Example 1: A software function plays music to “soothe and relax” an individual  and to “manage stress.” Such a software function is not a device function. 
This software function has claims that relate only to relaxation or stress management,  not to any disease or medical condition, and thus are general wellness claims. In  addition, the technology to play music does not pose a risk to the safety of users and  other persons if specific regulatory controls are not applied. Therefore, this product  meets both factors for a low risk general wellness product. 
Illustrative Example 2: A software function that solely monitors and records daily energy  expenditure and cardiovascular workout activities to “allow awareness of one’s exercise  activities to improve or maintain good cardiovascular health.” Such a software function is not  a device function. 
This software function has a claim that relates to a specific organ only in the context  of general health and does not refer to a disease or medical condition. In addition,  although the monitoring or recording of exercise activities present risks (such as  inaccuracy), when made in the absence of disease or medical condition claims, the  technology does not pose a risk to the safety of users and other persons if specific  regulatory controls are not applied. Therefore, this product meets both factors for a  low risk general wellness product. 
Illustrative Example 3: A software function monitors and records food consumption to  “manage dietary activity for weight management and alert the user, healthcare provider, or  family member of unhealthy dietary activity.” Such a software function is not a device  function. 
This software function has a claim that relates to dietary choices and weight  management, and thus is a general wellness claim. In addition, the technology for  monitoring or recording food consumption does not pose a risk to the safety of users  and other persons if specific regulatory controls are not applied. Therefore, this  product meets both factors for a low risk general wellness product. 
Illustrative Example 4: A software function that reminds users to keep exposed skin out of  direct sunlight when the UV index is high, which, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help  reduce the risk of skin cancer. 
This claim relates to tracking preventive measures which, as part of a healthy  lifestyle, may help reduce the risk of a medical condition. The claim is for a healthy  lifestyle choice and it is generally accepted that the choice may play an important role 
8 
Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
in health outcomes. Thus, it is a general wellness claim. In addition, the technology  reminding users to keep exposed skin out of direct sunlight does not pose a risk to the  safety of users and other persons if specific regulatory controls are not applied. Therefore, this product meets both factors for a low risk general wellness product. 
Illustrative Example 5: A portable product that is intended to monitor the pulse rate and/or  oxygen saturation of users during exercise and hiking. 
This claim relates only to exercise and hiking and does not refer to a disease or  medical condition. Thus, it is a general wellness claim. In addition, the technology for  monitoring pulse rate and/or oxygen saturation does not pose a risk to the safety of  users and other persons if specific regulatory controls are not applied. Therefore, this product meets both factors for a low risk general wellness product. 
Illustrative Example 6: A product is intended to mechanically exfoliate the face, hands and  feet to make the skin smoother and softer. The product cannot be used in a manner that  penetrates or pierces the skin. 
This claim relates to self-esteem and does not refer to a specific disease or medical  condition, and thus is a general wellness claim. In addition, the product is noninvasive  as it does not penetrate the stratum corneum and the technology for exfoliating the  face does not pose a risk to the safety of users and other persons if specific regulatory  controls are not applied. Therefore, this product meets both factors for a low risk  general wellness product. 
Note: However, if the product is intended to exfoliate the skin in order to enhance the  delivery of a topically applied product containing one or more active pharmaceutical  ingredients through the stratum corneum, the product would be invasive. Therefore,  the product would not be a low risk general wellness product. 
Illustrative Example 7: A wrist-worn wearable product intended to assess activity and  recovery that outputs multiple biomarkers, among which are hours slept, sleep quality, pulse  rate, and blood pressure. Sleep is measured via an accelerometer, while pulse rate and blood  pressure are measured via a photoplethysmogram. 
The claim relates to general wellness and does not refer to a specific disease or  medical condition, and thus is a general wellness claim. In addition, the technology  for monitoring these biomarkers does not pose a risk to the safety of users and other  persons if specific regulatory controls are not applied. Therefore, this product meets  both factors for a low risk general wellness product, provided the product has  validated values for blood pressure. 
Note: However, if the claims made about any of the product’s functionality implied  the product’s use in a medical or clinical context, the product would not be a low risk  general wellness product. 
Illustrative Example 8: A wearable product that is intended to provide estimations of blood  glucose for monitoring nutritional impacts. The blood glucose measurement is made via 
9 
Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
minimally invasive microneedle technology, is explicitly contraindicated for use with  diabetics and pre-diabetics, and is marketed to users as a means of better understanding their  insulin response to certain foods. 
This claim relates to a general understanding of a user’s health and is specifically  contraindicated for use with a specific disease or conditions. Thus, it is a general  wellness claim provided the product has validated values for blood glucose. However,  the product penetrates the stratum corneum and is therefore not a low risk general  wellness product. 
Illustrative Example 9: A non-invasive wearable product advertised toward elite athletes and  intended for monitoring of several parameters, among which are electrolyte balance, lactate,  and hemoglobin. The product is labeled as for use in an exercise/fitness context only,  displays values from cleared devices or ranges from the wearable’s optical sensor, and is  disclaimed for use diagnosing any condition or disorder.  
This claim relates to exercise and fitness and does not refer to a disease or medical  condition. Thus, it is a general wellness claim. In addition, the technology for measuring these physiologic parameters does not pose a risk to the safety of users and other  persons if specific regulatory controls are not applied, provided it has validated values  for these parameters. Therefore, this product meets both factors for a low risk general  wellness product. 
VI. Determining whether General Wellness Products are  within Scope of the Guidance 
The following questions reflect the framework described in this guidance to determine  whether general wellness products are within the scope of the guidance. Please note that  these questions are intended to be addressed in the context of the full text of the guidance. 
A1. Does the product have an intended use that relates to maintaining or encouraging  a general state of health or a healthy activity? 
Does the product only involve claims about sustaining or offering general improvement  to functions associated with a general state of health that do not make any reference to  diseases or conditions? Claims in this category include: weight management, physical  fitness, relaxation or stress management, mental acuity, self-esteem, sleep management,  or sexual function.

A2. Does the product have an intended use that relates the role of healthy lifestyle with  helping to reduce the risk or impact of certain chronic diseases or conditions? (In  answering this question, the following two questions must be considered together.) 
a) Does the product have an intended use that relates to sustaining or offering general  improvement to functions associated with a general state of health while making  reference to diseases or conditions, and where it is well understood and accepted that  healthy lifestyle choices may play an important role in health outcomes for the  disease or condition? 
AND 
b) Is the relation between healthy lifestyle and disease specifically expressed as “may  help to reduce the risk of,” or “may help living well with,” a chronic disease or  condition? 
YES 🡺 
Go to A3. Both questions A2(a) and A2(b) must be answered “Yes” in  order to proceed to question A3.
NO 🡺 
Product is NOT a low risk general wellness product, and is outside the  scope of this guidance.


A3. Is the product low risk? 
Is the product not invasive, and not implanted, and does not involve a technology that  may pose a risk to the safety of users or other persons if specific regulatory controls are  not applied, such as risks from lasers or radiation exposure? In answering this question,  consider whether CDRH actively regulates products of the same type as the product in  question.
YES 🡺 
The product is likely a general wellness product within the scope of  this guidance, but the factors and examples in the guidance should  be reviewed to confirm the status of the product.
NO 🡺 
Product is NOT a low risk general wellness product, and is outside the  scope of this guidance.
