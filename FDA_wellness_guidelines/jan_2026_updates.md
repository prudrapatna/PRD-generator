[Speaker 1]
Thank you, Kim.

[Speaker 2]
In general, the basic tenets of the General Wellness policy for low-risk devices guidance remain unchanged. Additional Clarity has been added to the guidance on products that perform non-invasive sensing of physiologic parameters.

Before we dive into the specifics, let's take a quick look at our learning objectives for this session. The goals of this presentation are to First Define what constitutes a general Wellness product under FDA guidelines. Second, we will reiterate bfda's current policy regarding low risk general Wellness products. Find how emerging Technologies specifically products that perform non-invasive sensing. Like, many modern wearables fit into this regulatory framework. This slide provides a background on the evolution of our guidance for General Wellness products. It outlines how we've refined our policy over the last decade to support low risk Innovation. Draft in 2015, which we finalized in 2016, establishing the core principles of enforcement discretion for products that are low risk and solely intended for General Wellness uses. Significant update came in September 2019 following the cures act. This was crucial as the cures act statutorily excluded. Certain software functions intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle from the definition of a medical device altogether. January 2026, we provided further Clarity on non-invasive sensing technology common in modern wearables, explaining how bees can remain categorized as general Wellness products. Here is our consistent approach to reducing regulatory burdens on low risk Technologies. As we gain additional experience with a product type, we can apply learnings to how we regulate devices. Next, we will move on to a slide that outlines the factors that FDA intends to consider in determining whether a product may be a low risk General Wellness product. Crh does not intend to examine low risk General Wellness products to determine whether they are devices within the meaning of the food, drug, and cosmetic act. Is whether they comply with the pre-market review and post-market regulatory requirements. Some of those requirements are registration and listing pre-market notification, labeling requirements, good manufacturing practice requirements, as well as mdrs, also known as medical device reporting requirements.

In the guidance, we Define General Wellness products as products that meet two criteria. They are only intended for General Wellness use and present a low risk to safety abusers and other persons. Should have only a general Wellness intended use, and it should be low risk as described in the guidance to be considered a low risk General Wellness product. The guidance describes two categories of General Wellness product intended uses. The first category is an intended use that relates to maintaining or encouraging a general state of health or healthy activity and does not make reference to a disease or condition. Library is an intended use that relates the role of a healthy lifestyle to helping to reduce the risk or impact of a disease or condition. The role that the healthy lifestyle may play in the health outcome for the disease or condition should be well understood and accepting. More specifically, the guidance explains that the first category of General Wellness intended uses involves claims about sustaining or offering General Improvement to functions associated with a general state of health

[Speaker 3]
Does not make any difference.

[Speaker 2]
General Wellness intended users can include a claim to promote or maintain a healthy weight, encourage healthy eating, or assist with weight loss goals, claims to promote relaxation or manage stress or claims to promote physical fitness. The guidance explains that the second category of General Wellness intended uses relates to sustaining or offering General Improvement to functions associated with a general state of health, while making reference to diseases or conditions and where it is well understood and accepted. That healthy lifestyle choices may play an important role in health outcomes for the disease or condition.

In this second category of General Wellness intended uses, there are two subcategories. This includes claims to promote, track and or encourage choices, which as part of a healthy lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of a certain chronic disease or condition or claims that your product promotes, tracks and encourages choices, which as part of the healthy lifestyle may help to living well with certain chronic disease or conditions. Some examples of these kinds of General Wellness intended uses include a product that promotes physical activity, which as part of a healthy lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of high blood pressure. Another example is software that tracks your calories and helps you manage a healthy eating plan to maintain a healthy weight and balanced diet. May help living well with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Another example of such General Wellness intended uses includes a product that tracks your sleep patterns and promotes healthy sleep habits, which may help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. And now we'll shift to evaluating whether the product is considered low risk. As described in this guidance, you should answer no to these three questions for the product to be considered low risk. Those questions include is the product invasive? Is the product implanted? And test the project involve an intervention or technology that poses a risk to the safety of users. If regulatory controls are not applied. Let's discuss some examples of products that present risk to the user's safety, which then are not considered low risk and therefore not a low risk General Wellness product, even if it could have a general Wellness intended use. A laser product that claims to improve a user's appearance by rejuvenating the skin would not be considered low risk. Although the claims of rejuvenating the skin and improving confidence in the user's appearance are General Wellness claims, the technology itself poses a risk of skin and eye burns. A neurostimulation product that claims to improve memory would not be considered low risk. Although they claims to improve memory, our general Wellness claims. The technology itself poses a risk to the user's safety from electrical stimulation. A wearable product that is intended to provide estimations of blood glucose for monitoring nutritional impacts. With blood glucose measurement is made via minimally invasive microneedle. Technology is explicitly contraindicated for use with diabetics and pre-diabetics and is marketed to users as a means of better understanding their insulin response to certain foods.

Relates to a general understanding of a user's health and is specifically contraindicated for use with a specific disease or conditions. Thus, it is a general Wellness intended use, provided the product has validated values for blood glucose. However, the product penetrates the stratum cornea and is therefore not a low risk general Wellness product. All right now. I'll hand it over to Anish to dive into the latest updates to the guidance.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you, Henry! Next, we will discuss the clarifying updates to the general Wellness guidance from January 6th, 2026. These updates reflect current agency policy toward low-risk General Wellness products. Two updates involve clarifications about what products are considered low-risk. General Wellness products, including those that use non-invasive sensing and provide certain user notifications. Also, three examples were added to illustrate these clarifications.

Certification relates to products that use non-invasive sensing for General Wellness purposes. Projects that use non-invasive sensing, such as Optical sensing to estimate, infer, or output physiologic parameters may be considered General Wellness products when the outputs are intended solely for wellness uses and the products align with the considerations outlined in the guidance and shared on the slide.

In this category can display values, ranges, Trends, baselines, or longitudinal summaries contextualized in relation to sleep activity, stress recovery, or similar Wellness domains. To be considered a low risk General bonus product. Within this category, the product should not be intended to measure, estimate, or report physiological values with medical or clinical purposes, including screening, diagnosis, monitoring, alerting, or management of a disease or condition. Labeling, advertising, user interface, and functionality for the product should not include specific references to specific diseases, equivalent conditions, or diagnostic thresholds. Alerts, alarms, or prompts that recommend or require specific clinical action or medical management. Treatment guidance intended to inform or direct medical management claims of clinical equivalence, clinical accuracy, medical or clinical grade, or substitution for authorized device.

Degree or management of a disease or condition. The second clarification relates to products that provide user notifications. These products may include, but are not limited to, those that use non-invasive sensing to Output physiologic parameters. Provide notifications to a user evaluation by Healthcare. Professionals may be helpful when outputs fall outside range is appropriate for General Wellness. Use may be considered General Wellness products. Should not identify or name a specific disease or medical condition should not characterize the output as abnormal pathologic or diagnostic should not include clinical thresholds, diagnoses, or treatment recommendations and should not provide ongoing alerts or monitoring intended to manage a disease or condition. To support the two clarifications, we have added three illustrative examples to the guidance, huh? That outputs multiple places are based on non-invasive sensing, um, a form of optical sensing, provided the physiologic parameters are validated. This is a low risk General Wellness. About the products with reality. Oh, that is General Wellness product. The second new example, example 8, is for a wearable product that provides estimations of blood glucose for monitoring nutritional impacts and has a general Wellness intended use. Example is not animal restaurant bonus product because it is invasive.

The third new example, example 9, is for a non-invasive, wearable product that outputs physiologic parameters, including electrolyte balance, flat tape, and heat fluid. Because it has a general wellness intended use and does not pose a risk to the safety of users and provided values are validated. It is a low risk General Wellness product. Why are you here?

Guidance General moments policy for low risk devices, including clarifications of the guidance issued on January 6, 2026. Patients were focused on products they use non-invasive sensing and provide user notifications. Examples were discussed to illustrate the policy clarifications.

[Speaker 1]
Thank you Anish and Henry for your presentations.

As I mentioned earlier for this town hall, we will be addressing some previously emailed questions about today's topic. I will read a question, and then Anish will provide a response. Anish. Our first question is. Should manufacturers and developers reach out to FDA for updated feedback?

[Speaker 3]
Thanks, Kim! If you have any questions about how the updated version of the General Wellness guidance may impact your product, we recommend that you submit a pre-submission to the review division that may be responsible for your product or a product that provides similar physiologic parameters or values, office of product evaluation and quality or effect review teams will will be working closely with digital Health Center of Excellence or dhcoe to provide clear Direction and consistency with the updated guidance.

[Speaker 1]
The next question is? The guidance states that non-invasive sensing products may not be General Wellness products if they include values that mimic those views clinically, unless validated to reflect those values. Does it mean for a physiologic parameter or value to be validated? Does information supporting validation need to be made public?

[Speaker 3]
A physiologic parameter or value can be validated through a variety of means, including testing conducted by the manufacturer and publication of validation. Results in a peer-reviewed journal. FDA encourages making validation results public if information supporting the validation of a physiologic parameter or value are not made public. FDA may request a summary of the information supporting validation under this policy. There are no specific requirements for validation, but manufacturers are encouraged to consider whether it's.

Standards requirements propagated by professional societies and other criteria.

[Speaker 1]
Thanks again Anish. This next question consists of a few questions, so here they are.

[Speaker 3]
What does it

[Speaker 1]
Mean for a product to use non-invasive sensing? Does that include inflatable cuffs? Our micro needle based Technologies, such as some continuous glucose meters within the scope of this policy. Are other products such as urine analysis, test strips included.

[Speaker 3]
Products that are non-invasive, non-implanted, and do not involve an intervention or technology that may pose a risk to the safety of users or other person's specific regulatory controls are not applied generally are considered low risk. Those that use Optical sensing, such as photoplythemography, accelerometer data, and environmental data, depending on the specific context of use. This may include products that use an inflatable cuff. Micro needle, such as continuous glucose monitors, are invasive and not considered low risk. And therefore not considered low risk General Wellness products. However, if the product was non-invasive and had solely a general Wellness intended, use that it may be a low risk General Wellness product. This could include certain wearable software products that provide help or Wellness recommendations based on glucose measurements made by a separate medical device. When those recommendations have a general Wellness intended use. Be considered. General bonus projects provided the products have a general bonus intended use and are low risk. However, the design and labeling of your analysis. Test strips available today are just intended uses. That would not be a general bonus intended use, such as for the identification of a urinary tract, infection, or ketoacidosis.

[Speaker 1]
Thanks for addressing all the parts of that question Anish. All right. The next question is the guidance says that a product may still be a low risk General Wellness product if it provides notifications, informing a user that evaluation by a health care provider may be helpful when values exceed ranges for General Wellness use. These notifications look like and on what thresholds.

[Speaker 3]
A product may still be a low risk General Wellness products if it provides notifications when outputs fall outside. Range is appropriate for General Wellness use. These notifications should not name a specific medical disease or condition. However, range is appropriate for General Wellness. Use may fall within the clinical thresholds Divine for specific medical diseases or conditions, such as 100 beats per minute, progressing heart rate, being an accepted threshold for tachycardia. In this case, low risk General loan.

Value of the threshold or name, the specific medical disease or condition, low risk General Wellness products can also indicate that a physiologic parameter is higher or lower than a threshold. For example, your resting heart rate was high over the past few days. You should check with your doctor if this is an unexpected result. In addition, such notifications should not include other features such as colors or sounds that characterize the output as abnormal pathological or diagnostic. These limitations do not preclude notifications that are triggered by or include numeric values for thresholds defined by the user, user Community, or those that are based on typical values for the user or user Community, which may not be those typically used by the medical.

[Speaker 1]
Finish. The next question is, are there low risk General Wellness products that make reference to specific diseases or conditions?

[Speaker 3]
The general Wellness guidance includes a category of General Wellness products that have intended uses that make reference to diseases or conditions and relate to sustaining or offering General Improvement to functions associated with the general state of health. These products may help users live well with or may help reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases or conditions. These products do not perform non-invasive sensing of physiologic parameters.

Thanks

[Speaker 1]
Anish! All right. For our next question, that is. Do the clarified policies on non-invasive sensing and user notifications applied to both adults and children.

Will

[Speaker 3]
Risk General Wellness products may be intended for use by both adults and children, provided the products are consistent with the policy that the product has a general bonus intended use and is low. Risk manufacturers should consider the characteristics of an intended use population and determining where the product has a general Wellness intended use. Measurement of blood oxygen in an infant population may not relate to maintaining or encouraging a general state of health or healthy activity. We recommend reaching out to the review division responsible for your product or a product that provides similar physiologic parameters or values. For additional feedback on products intended for general wellness use by specific populations.

[Speaker 1]
Thanks again Anish. The next question is? Are there any cyber security requirements or limitations on data sharing?

[Speaker 3]
As described in the general Wellness guidance and which remains unchanged in. Accepting FDA does not intend to save in compliance with device requirements, including cyber security requirements and the federal food truck and cosmetic act and its implementing regulations for low risk General Wellness products, data communication and privacy requirements administered by other agencies May apply. Patients may choose to share such data output from low-risk General Wellness products with their healthcare provider.

[Speaker 1]
Niche. One last question for today, and that is. Are any previously authorized devices no longer being regulated? Also, how should one differentiate between an FDA authorized device and a low risk General Wellness product?

[Speaker 3]
Stated in guidance. A wellness product is solely for wellness uses and not intended to substitute for an FDA authorized ice. FDA does not intend to change the classification of any previously authorized devices based on the recommendations in this guidance. Sites that a product within the scope of this policy should have only a general wellness intended use as described in the guidance and be low risk. FDA continues to actively regulate devices that non-invasively measure blood pressure when they are not intent solely for a general Wellness intended use.

General Wellness products should review the guidance and learn more about what FDA considers to be appropriate. General Wellness intended uses for General Wellness Products labeling should not include statements regarding being medical or clinical grade.

[Speaker 1]
Thanks Anish! That wraps up our questions and answers for this town hall. I appreciate Niche and the center for providing responses to those questions.

I'll now turn it back over to you Anish for some closing remarks regarding today's topic.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you Kim! Today, we discuss clarifications to the FDA guidance on General Wellness policy for low-risk devices shared. On January 6, 2026. The clarifications address General Wellness products that output physiologic parameters or values and user notifications. If you have any questions, we recommend leveraging our Q submission program to obtain additional feedback. Thank you all for your time today.
