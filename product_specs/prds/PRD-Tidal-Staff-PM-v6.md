## 1. TL;DR

**What It Is:**
Google Personal Health Agent is an AI-powered wellness platform that works invisibly in the background on your Google wearable, monitoring your blood pressure patterns without any effort on your part. It's a general wellness tool (not a medical device) that uses advanced photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors and machine learning to estimate cardiovascular wellness ranges.

**The Experience:**
You wear your compatible Google wearable as usual—no cuffs, no calibration, no manual measurements. Every week, you receive a calm, reassuring summary showing whether your wellness range was stable. If your blood pressure patterns stay elevated for a sustained period (typically 30 days), you'll receive a single, empathetic notification explaining what might be contributing to the shift—like decreased sleep or increased stress—along with personalized guidance on specific lifestyle changes that, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help bring your range back toward baseline. The system doesn't alarm you with daily alerts; it respects your attention while giving you the insights and coaching you need, when you need them. If patterns persist, it encourages you to consult with a healthcare provider.

**Who It's For:**
The 20 million young adults (18-44) with unrecognized elevated blood pressure patterns who feel healthy, are building their lives, and want proactive wellness insights without medicalizing their daily routines. This gives them awareness, actionable guidance, and the opportunity to optimize their cardiovascular wellness decades before problems emerge.

## 2. Strategic Context

### Mission Alignment: The Personal Health Agent Revolution

Google Health exists to democratize preventive healthcare by making advanced health insights accessible, affordable, and anxiety-free for everyone. **Personal Health Agent** advances this mission by transforming the relationship between users and their cardiovascular wellness—from passive awareness to **active lifestyle guidance**.

Here's the breakthrough: **Elevated blood pressure may be improved through lifestyle change.** Research shows that improving sleep quality (7+ hours), reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, and managing stress, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help bring blood pressure back to healthier ranges in many cases. But most people never get the chance to try because they don't know they're elevated until it's a medical crisis.

We're changing that. For the first time, a **Personal Health Agent**—an intelligent companion—makes the invisible visible, then guides you toward the specific lifestyle changes that, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help support improvements in your elevated range. When patterns consistently show you're out of range, we'll notify you to consider consulting with a healthcare provider. This is not passive tracking. This is **active intervention** through personalized coaching, delivered with the gentleness of a friend and the rigor of clinical science.

**The Young Adult Crisis:** This matters most for the 20 million young adults (18-44) with undetected elevated blood pressure. They're not "old enough" to worry. They feel fine. They're building careers, raising families, living full lives—unaware that silent cardiovascular stress is accumulating. By the time symptoms appear (chest pain, stroke), decades of damage have occurred. We're reaching them now, in their 30s and 40s, when lifestyle interventions have maximum impact and decades of health to protect.

### Market Positioning: The Personal Health Agent Category

We are defining a new category: **Personal Health Agent for Cardiovascular Wellness**. This is not "blood pressure tracking" (medical device positioning). This is not "cuff replacement" (competing with Omron). This is not even "passive data collection" (wearables status quo).

This is the first **agentic system** for cardiovascular wellness—an intelligent companion that identifies invisible patterns, predicts lifestyle impact, and actively guides users with personalized interventions that, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help support improvements in elevated ranges. Competitors give you numbers. We give you a roadmap to change them.

**Competitive Moat:**
- **Identify + Guide + Support:** Only system that closes the loop from pattern identification → lifestyle guidance → progress tracking → healthcare consultation encouragement (vs. competitors' "here's your number, good luck")
- **Passive + Calibration-Free:** Zero user effort for data collection (vs. Samsung's monthly calibration burden)
- **ABPM Validation Standard:** Gold-standard ground truth capturing 24-hour patterns including sleep (vs. Apple's home BP baseline which misses nocturnal patterns)
- **Longitudinal Intelligence:** 30-day analysis windows distinguish sustained patterns from temporary stress spikes
- **Predictive World Model:** Multi-horizon prediction showing users "if I sleep more, my range may improve" with 80% probability (vs. competitors' reactive logbooks)
- **Personalized Lifestyle Coaching:** AI-powered sleep, stress, and activity interventions tailored to your patterns (vs. generic advice)

### Success at Scale

If we achieve 15% penetration of Google's wearable ecosystem user base (5M users), we will identify an estimated 500,000 individuals with unrecognized cardiovascular risk who can then seek appropriate medical evaluation and care. At population scale (50M wearers across our product portfolio), we can bridge the awareness gap for millions—enabling earlier healthcare consultations and lifestyle interventions that, when combined with proper medical care, can help reduce the downstream healthcare costs from elevated blood pressure patterns.

More importantly, we will have proven that **Google Personal Health Agent**, as a platform-agnostic AI system, can deliver public health impact across multiple form factors—making preventive care universally accessible regardless of which Google wearable device users choose.

## 3. Intended Use (Regulatory North Star)

**Source:** FDA General Wellness Guidance (January 2026), Example 7

The Blood Pressure Notification feature is a **general wellness tool** intended to estimate blood pressure values and trends for **informational and educational purposes only**. It is designed to promote positive lifestyle behavior changes in sleep, activity, nutrition, and stress management by educating users and helping them understand how their daily habits correlate with estimated blood pressure range.

**Lifestyle Intervention Component:**
The feature provides personalized coaching and guidance on lifestyle choices which, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help bring cardiovascular wellness range back to baseline. This includes:
- Sleep improvement coaching and tracking
- Stress management techniques and breathing exercises
- Activity recommendations based on individual patterns
- Educational content on how lifestyle factors influence cardiovascular wellness

The feature provides notifications when values fall outside of general wellness ranges to prompt users to reflect on their habits, engage with personalized lifestyle coaching, or consider evaluation by a healthcare professional if patterns persist. It is **not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical issue**.

**Clinical Context:**
Research demonstrates that lifestyle interventions (improved sleep, reduced sodium, increased activity, stress management), as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help support cardiovascular wellness in individuals with elevated blood pressure ranges. This feature educates users on these well-established associations and helps them implement such choices as part of a healthy lifestyle.

**Regulatory Classification:** General Wellness (FDA Enforcement Discretion - Non-Invasive, Low Risk, Validated Output)

**Contraindications:**
- Not intended for use during pregnancy (hemodynamic changes invalidate algorithm assumptions)
- Not intended for users with known cardiac arrhythmias requiring management
- Not intended as a substitute for clinical blood pressure measurement or home blood pressure devices

**What This Means for Users:**
This feature helps you understand the relationship between your lifestyle choices and your cardiovascular wellness range. It is not a medical device, and it does not replace advice or devices prescribed by your healthcare provider. If you receive persistent notifications, we recommend consulting a healthcare professional to understand your full cardiovascular health picture.

## 4. The Press Release (Narrative)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Google Announces "Personal Health Agent": Your Intelligent Partner for Cardiovascular Wellness**

**MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA** — Today, Google introduces **Personal Health Agent**, a revolutionary AI-powered wellness platform for Google's wearable ecosystem that transforms how people understand and optimize their cardiovascular health. By making blood pressure patterns visible through continuous, passive intelligence, and providing personalized lifestyle guidance, Personal Health Agent empowers millions to take proactive steps toward better wellness—before patterns become concerns.

### The Opportunity: Unlocking Your Body's Hidden Signals

Your body is constantly communicating with you—but some of its most important messages are invisible. Blood pressure patterns shift throughout your day in response to sleep, stress, activity, and countless lifestyle factors. Yet unlike energy levels or mood, these patterns exist beneath conscious awareness.

This creates a unique opportunity. **Research shows that lifestyle interventions—improved sleep, stress management, increased activity—can, as part of a healthy lifestyle, help bring cardiovascular wellness ranges back toward baseline in many individuals.** But to make these improvements, you first need awareness.

For the 20 million young adults (18-44) building careers, raising families, and living full lives, cardiovascular wellness often isn't top of mind. They feel great. They're active. They assume they're healthy. And they are—but with insight into their patterns, they could optimize even further, protecting decades of future health.

The challenge isn't lack of solutions—it's lack of awareness. Traditional approaches require deliberate effort: scheduling appointments, using cuffs, remembering to measure. For busy, healthy-feeling people, these barriers mean cardiovascular wellness stays invisible. Until now.

### The Solution: Your Intelligent Wellness Partner

**Google Personal Health Agent** changes the equation. It's not about the device—it's about the intelligence. There is no cuff. There is no calibration. You simply wear your compatible Google wearable, and your personal agent works for you—watching, learning, and guiding.

Using advanced photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors available across Google's wearable portfolio and Google's novel **Waveform Foundation Model**—a deep learning system trained on millions of heartbeat patterns—your agent learns the unique rhythm of your cardiovascular system. It observes in the background, day and night, building a longitudinal understanding of your wellness patterns across weeks and months.

But here's the breakthrough: **it transforms awareness into action.** When your agent identifies patterns worth exploring, it doesn't just notify you—it becomes your coach. It analyzes your sleep quality, stress patterns, activity levels, and recovery data to pinpoint the specific lifestyle factors that correlate with your cardiovascular wellness. Then it guides you—with empathy, personalization, and evidence—toward changes that, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help optimize your wellness.

*"I've noticed your wellness range has shifted over the past 4 weeks, which correlates with your sleep decreasing from 7.5 to 6.2 hours per night. Research shows that improving sleep, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help bring cardiovascular wellness range back toward baseline. Would you like to try a personalized 14-day Sleep Coaching plan? I'll guide you step by step."*

This is the difference between passive tracking and active partnership. Between data and understanding. Between awareness and empowerment.

**The 7-Star Experience: Effortless Awareness, Empowering Action**

- **The Invisible Setup:** You enable Personal Health Agent in your Google Health app. That's it. No onboarding flow. No calibration ritual. While you live your life, the system quietly learns your baseline over 14 days. You get a single notification: "Personal Health Agent is learning your patterns. You'll receive your first insights next Monday."

- **The Weekly Check-In:** Every Monday morning, you wake up to a "Weekly Wellness Summary" card in your Google Health app. It shows a simple, calming visualization: "Your range was stable last week." Below it, the system highlights positive correlations: "Your consistent sleep (avg 7.5 hrs, up from 6.8) may have contributed to maintaining your wellness range."

- **The Proactive Partner:** If life gets busy and your patterns shift over several weeks, your agent doesn't alarm you—it offers guidance. No red colors. No clinical terms. Instead, it becomes your coach: "I've noticed your wellness range has shifted over 4 weeks, which correlates with your sleep decreasing to 6.2 hrs/night (down from 7.5 hrs). Research shows that improving sleep, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help optimize cardiovascular wellness. Would you like to try a personalized 14-day Sleep Coaching plan? If patterns continue, I'll remind you to consider consulting with a healthcare provider."

- **The Optimization Journey:** You engage with the coaching plan. Over 14 days, your agent sends supportive daily guidance: "Try a 10-minute wind-down routine tonight," "Your bedtime consistency improved 40% this week—excellent progress." After 2 weeks, you track your results: "Your sleep averaged 7.4 hrs during coaching (up from 6.2 hrs). Continue monitoring to see how these changes support your wellness. If you'd like additional support, consider discussing with your healthcare provider."

This is not a medical device issuing warnings. This is not a passive sensor logging data. This is **Google Personal Health Agent**—an AI platform that works across your wearables, making patterns visible, insights actionable, and wellness optimization achievable.

### Why This Matters: Intelligence That Empowers

Most wearables are logbooks. They record. They report. They say "here's your number."

**Google Personal Health Agent** is different. It is a **World Model**—a simulation of your physiology that understands cause and effect. It doesn't just tell you your patterns shifted; it explains *why* by correlating it with sleep quality, activity patterns, stress windows, and recovery metrics. It predicts: "If you improve sleep by 60 minutes, there's an 80% probability your wellness range may optimize within 7 days."

This is the difference between tracking and coaching. Between reactive data and proactive guidance. Between information and understanding. And because it's an AI platform, not a device feature, it gets smarter over time—learning from millions of users to provide increasingly personalized insights, regardless of which Google wearable you use.

### What We're Building

**Internal Quote:**
*"For decades, cardiovascular wellness has been reactive—waiting for problems to appear before taking action. Google Personal Health Agent makes wellness proactive and accessible. We're empowering people with insights into patterns they can't feel, connected to lifestyle actions they can take. For 20 million young adults who are healthy today and want to stay that way, this is the partner that helps them optimize for decades ahead. When patterns shift persistently, we help them understand what's happening and support them in consulting healthcare providers for additional guidance. And because this is an AI platform, not a device-specific feature, we're building something that scales across our entire wearable portfolio—making wellness intelligence universal."* — VP, Google Health

**Customer Quote:**
*"I'm 36 and always thought I was doing great health-wise. Then my Personal Health Agent showed me a pattern I couldn't feel—my wellness range had shifted over 5 weeks, correlating with my sleep dropping to 6 hours after my daughter was born. But here's what changed everything: it didn't scare me. It coached me. It showed me the connection and gave me a clear path forward. I did the Sleep Coaching plan while also checking in with my doctor. Together with my healthcare team and the lifestyle guidance from the app, I've been able to work on optimizing my wellness. That's when I realized: this isn't about my watch. It's about having an intelligent partner that helps me understand my body and take action. It's given me confidence that I'm protecting my health for the long term."* — Marcus, 36, Early Tester

### Get Started

Google Personal Health Agent will be available starting Q3 2026 across Google's wearable ecosystem as part of the Google Health app (no additional subscription required). Simply enable the feature in your Google Health app, and your agent begins working for you automatically—regardless of which compatible Google wearable you choose.

## 6. Problem & Opportunity

### The Invisibility Crisis

Blood pressure is fundamentally imperceptible. Unlike pain, fatigue, or shortness of breath—symptoms that create urgency—high blood pressure exists in silence. You cannot feel your systolic pressure at 145 mmHg versus 120 mmHg. Your body gives no warning until the damage is done.

This invisibility drives a catastrophic awareness gap:

- **50% of Americans** have elevated blood pressure patterns
- **~60-70% of young adults (18-44)** with elevated patterns are unaware
- **20 million people** are walking around with dangerous cardiovascular stress, oblivious
- By the time symptoms appear (chest pain, stroke, heart attack), irreversible damage has occurred

### Why the Status Quo Fails: The "Active Effort" Barrier

Current solutions require active, intentional effort:

- **Office Blood Pressure:** Infrequent (annual visits at best), prone to "White Coat Effect" (anxiety-induced false highs)
- **Home Cuffs:** Require purchasing hardware, remembering to use it 2x/day for 5-7 days, enduring the squeeze, and interpreting results
- **Ambulatory Devices (ABPM):** Gold standard but requires clinical prescription, 24-hour cuff wear, and medical interpretation

The result? The "invincible" young demographic—those most at risk from decades of unrecognized elevated patterns—simply don't check. Why would you, when you feel fine?

### The Google Health Differentiation: Passive Intelligence

We are not trying to replace cuffs or compete with medical devices. We are solving a different problem: **bridging the awareness gap through passive, longitudinal intelligence.**

**Our Unique Approach:**

1. **Passive Sensing:** No user action required. Data collection happens in the background during normal wear.
2. **Calibration-Free:** No setup burden (vs. Samsung's monthly cuff calibration requirement).
3. **Longitudinal Analysis:** 30-day rolling windows distinguish sustained patterns from temporary spikes (one stressful meeting ≠ elevated wellness range).
4. **ABPM Ground Truth:** We validate against 24-hour ambulatory assessment (gold standard) which captures nocturnal dipping and true variability, unlike competitors using home BP (waking hours only).
5. **World Model Reasoning:** Multi-horizon prediction showing users the relationship between lifestyle choices (sleep, stress, activity) and cardiovascular wellness range.

## 6. Validation & Competitive Rigor

### Target Performance (The Benchmark)

Our goal is to demonstrate **non-inferiority to Office Blood Pressure** measurement when both are compared to the gold standard: 24-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Assessment (ABPM).

**Clinical Context:**
Office BP is the current standard of care for screening, yet it has well-documented limitations (White Coat Effect, single time-point measurement). The USPSTF systematic review (Guirguis-Blake et al., JAMA 2021) established Office BP performance against ABPM:

| Metric | **Office BP Benchmark** | **Source** |
|:-------|:----------------------|:-----------|
| **Sensitivity** | 54% (95% CI: 37%, 70%) | USPSTF Review vs. ABPM |
| **Specificity** | 90% (95% CI: 84%, 95%) | USPSTF Review vs. ABPM |

Our target is comparability to this benchmark—not perfection, but clinical relevance.

---

### Current Performance (Tidal V1 Algorithm)

**Internal Validation Study (N=663):**

| Metric | **Tidal V1 Performance** | **Target Benchmark** | **Status** |
|:-------|:----------------------|:--------------------|:-----------|
| **Sensitivity** | 53% (95% CI: 40%, 64%) | 54% (95% CI: 37%, 70%) | ✅ **On Track** (Within CI) |
| **Specificity** | 93% (95% CI: 86%, 96%) | 90% (95% CI: 84%, 95%) | ✅ **Exceeds Target** |
| **Ground Truth** | 24-Hour ABPM | 24-Hour ABPM | ✅ **Gold Standard** |

**What This Means:**
- **Sensitivity (53%):** Of users with sustained elevated BP (confirmed by ABPM), we correctly identify 53%—comparable to Office BP (54%).
- **Specificity (93%):** Of users with normal BP, we correctly classify 93% as "in range"—*better* than Office BP (90%), meaning fewer false alarms.

**Transparency Note:**
Our sensitivity is not 90%+. We are not perfect. But we are comparable to the clinical standard (Office BP) while being *passive and continuous*—capturing patterns Office BP misses (nocturnal hypertension, day-to-day variability). This is the trade-off we make to democratize access.

---

### Validation Plan (The Pivotal Study)

To confirm performance at scale, we are conducting a multi-site clinical study:

**Study Design:**
- **Sample Size:** N=1,600 participants
- **Demographics:** Representative US population (age, sex, BMI, skin tone per Fitzpatrick scale)
- **Ground Truth:** 24-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Assessment (ABPM) for all participants
- **Endpoints:** Sensitivity and specificity for identifying sustained elevated BP (SBP ≥130 or DBP ≥80 over 14+ days)
- **Subgroup Analyses:** Performance stratified by age, BMI, skin tone to ensure equity

**Objective:** Demonstrate statistical non-inferiority to Office BP for identifying sustained elevated blood pressure patterns.

**Timeline:**
- Q2 2026: Study initiation
- Q4 2026: Data lock
- Q1 2027: Peer-reviewed publication

| **Key Differentiator** | Captures sleep BP, longitudinal patterns | High specificity | On-demand readings | Medical-grade accuracy |

---

### Competitive Positioning Summary

**Where We Win:**
1. **Passive + Calibration-Free:** No user burden (Apple shares this, Samsung does not)
2. **Gold Standard Validation:** ABPM captures 24-hour patterns including nocturnal dipping—Apple and Samsung validate only against waking home BP
3. **Longitudinal Intelligence:** 30-day analysis windows vs. spot-check mentality
4. **World Model Reasoning:** Predicts lifestyle impact on range vs. reactive logging

**Where Competitors Win:**
1. **Medical Device Claims:** Apple/Samsung can use terms like "blood pressure tracking," we cannot (regulatory trade-off for accessibility)
2. **Absolute Values:** Samsung/Omron provide numerical readings (120/80), we provide ranges (regulatory constraint for general wellness)

**Strategic Choice:**
We accept the constraint of general wellness positioning because it unlocks accessibility without prescription barriers. Our target user (Proactive Adopter) wants awareness, not diagnosis. Peace of mind, not medical oversight.

## 7. App Overview (The 7-Star Mobile Experience)

**Philosophy:** The wearable is the sensor. The AI is the brain. The phone is the interface. All user-facing intelligence, insights, and interactions happen in the Google Health mobile app. **Google Personal Health Agent** is a platform that works across any compatible wearable in our ecosystem, ensuring users get consistent, intelligent guidance regardless of device choice.

### The Health World Model

We are building beyond reactive data logging—we are creating a **World Model** of the user's cardiovascular health.

**What is a World Model?**
A simulation of the user's physiology that understands cause-and-effect relationships. It learns:
- *"When this user sleeps 7+ hours, their wellness range stabilizes within 3 days"*
- *"Stress events (identified via HRV drops) correlate with 5-7 day range elevations"*
- *"Increased walking (8k+ steps/day) corresponds to 10% lower vascular stiffness proxy"*

**Multi-Horizon Prediction:**
The system doesn't just report the past; it predicts the future. Users can ask (or the system proactively suggests): *"If I prioritize sleep this week, what happens to my range?"* The model runs a shadow simulation and answers with probability: *"80% chance your range returns to baseline within 7 days."*

**Cost Function (The Path of Least Resistance):**
The system assigns a "biological cost" to user choices. It surfaces the interventions with the highest impact and lowest effort:
- *"A 10-minute walk costs you 10 minutes but improves vascular recovery 15%. A 60-minute nap costs 60 minutes but improves recovery 8%."*

This is not about nagging users. It's about giving them agency through intelligence.

---

### Mobile Experience Flow

#### **Phase 1: The Invisible Setup (Day 0-14)**

**User Action:** Enable Google Personal Health Agent during wearable setup or in Google Health App settings.

**System Behavior:**
1. User taps "Enable Personal Health Agent"
2. System prompts for **Height** (mandatory—critical for algorithm accuracy)
3. Confirmation screen: *"Personal Health Agent is learning your baseline. Wear your compatible wearable as usual. You'll receive your first insights in 14 days."*

**Design Note:**
No progress bars. No daily updates. No anxiety-inducing "calibration mode." The system works invisibly across all compatible devices. Users forget about it until Monday morning.

---

- **Context, not commands:** Explain *why* things happened, don't just report *what* happened
- **Empowerment, not judgment:** Celebrate progress, normalize variance

---

#### **Phase 3: The Caring Nudge (If Patterns Persist)**

**Trigger Logic:**
If user has ≥14 valid days in a rolling 30-day window, and ≥70% of those days show elevated wellness range (probability > threshold), system generates a persistent elevation notification.

**Notification:**
*"Your wellness range has been elevated for 4 weeks."*

**In-App Experience:**
- **Empathetic Opening:** *"I've noticed your wellness range has been elevated for 4 weeks. This isn't an emergency, but patterns like this can be worth exploring."*
- **Potential Factors:** System highlights correlations (e.g., sleep decreased by 45 min/night, stress events increased 3x)
- **Actionable Paths (User Choice):**
  1. *"Start a 14-Day Sleep Coaching Plan"* (Guided intervention within app)
  2. *"Review My Lifestyle Patterns"* (Detailed correlation analysis)
  3. *"Talk to a Healthcare Provider"* (Export summary PDF for doctor visit)

**What We Don't Do:**
- ❌ No red colors or alarms
- ❌ No diagnostic language ("You may have hypertension")
- ❌ No absolute BP numbers
- ❌ No ongoing daily alerts (respects user attention)

### Structured Functional Requirements (Gherkin Format)

#### **FR-01: Sensing & Data Ingestion (Day-Late Cadence)**

**Category:** Sensing

**Requirement:**
As a system, I must ensure data completeness by processing PPG data in overnight batch jobs, accepting a "day-late" view for accuracy over real-time presentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 01: Overnight Data Processing**
- **Given** User wears watch on Day T with ≥12 hours of valid wear time
- **When** Nightly batch processing runs at Day T+1 (02:00 AM local time)
- **Then** PPG data for Day T is ingested, tokenized, and uploaded to cloud
- **And** Inference pipeline generates `DailyWellnessRange` entry for Day T
- **And** Data becomes visible in app by 08:00 AM Day T+1
- **And** NO partial/incomplete data is shown for Day T+1 (prevents user confusion)

**Scenario 02: Insufficient Wear Time**
- **Given** User wears watch on Day T for only 8 hours
- **When** Nightly processing runs
- **Then** Day T is marked as `invalid_day` (wear time < MIN_WEAR_DURATION)
- **And** No `DailyWellnessRange` entry is created
- **And** Day T does not count toward weekly or monthly valid day thresholds

**Error Handling:**
- IF processing pipeline fails, retry 3x with exponential backoff
- IF failure persists > 48 hours, show in-app banner: *"Data processing delayed. We're working on it."*
- Log failure to operations dashboard with alert to on-call SRE

---

#### **FR-02: Weekly Reactive View (Monday Morning Summary)**

**Category:** Logic

**Requirement:**
As a user, I want a reactive weekly summary of my wellness range so I can understand patterns without daily interruption.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 03: Generate Weekly Summary (Sufficient Data)**
- **Given** User has ≥7 valid days in the last 7-day window (Mon-Sun)
- **When** It is Monday at 08:00 AM local time
- **Then** Generate `WeeklySummary` entry
- **And** Calculate `range_status`:
  - IF < 30% of days have `probability_elevated` > `HTN_THRESHOLD` → "Stable"
  - ELSE → "Elevated"
- **And** Correlate with lifestyle data:
  - `avg_sleep_hours` = AVG(sleep duration for valid days)
  - `avg_steps` = AVG(step count for valid days)
  - `avg_hrv` = AVG(HRV for valid days)
- **And** Send push notification: *"Your weekly wellness range is ready."*

**Scenario 04: Insufficient Data for Weekly View**
- **Given** User has < 7 valid days in the last 7-day window
- **When** It is Monday at 08:00 AM
- **Then** NO push notification is sent
- **And** In-app card shows: *"Wear your watch more consistently to see weekly insights. You had X valid days this week (need 7)."*

**Error Handling:**
- IF `avg_sleep_hours` or `avg_steps` data unavailable (user disabled Fitbit integration), show generic summary without lifestyle correlation

---

#### **FR-03: Persistent Elevation Identification (Monthly Proactive Check)**

**Category:** Logic

**Requirement:**
As a system, I must identify sustained elevated wellness range patterns over 30 days to notify users of persistent shifts worth exploring.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 05: Persistent Elevation Identified**
- **Given** User has ≥14 valid days in the last 30-day rolling window
- **And** COUNT(days where `probability_elevated` > `HTN_THRESHOLD`) / 14 ≥ 0.70 (70%)
- **When** Monthly check runs (every Monday at 08:05 AM)
- **Then** Create `PersistentElevationNotification` entry
- **And** Send push notification: *"Your wellness range has been elevated for 4 weeks."*
- **And** In-app experience shows:
  - Empathetic context: *"Patterns like this can be worth exploring."*
  - Lifestyle correlations: Highlight changes in sleep, stress, activity
  - Action options: [Sleep Coaching] [Review Patterns] [Talk to Provider]

**Scenario 06: Borderline Case (69% of days elevated)**
- **Given** User has 14 valid days, 9 elevated (64%)
- **When** Monthly check runs
- **Then** NO persistent elevation notification sent (threshold not met)
- **And** User sees normal weekly summaries (no alarm for transient variability)

**Scenario 07: User Already Notified (Cooldown Period)**
- **Given** User received a persistent elevation notification on Day T
- **And** Current date is Day T+21 (within 30-day cooldown)
- **When** Monthly check runs and criteria still met
- **Then** NO new notification sent (prevent notification fatigue)
- **And** In-app card remains accessible for user to review

**Error Handling:**
- IF calculation ambiguous (e.g., exactly 70.0% due to floating point), round down (favor NOT notifying to avoid false alarms)

---

#### **FR-04: User Profile & Height Management**

**Category:** User Profile

**Requirement:**
As a system, I must enforce valid height input and reset calibration when height changes, as height is a critical feature for algorithm accuracy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 08: Valid Height Input**
- **Given** User is in onboarding flow or Settings > Personal Health Agent
- **When** User enters height
- **Then** Validate: `HEIGHT_MIN` ≤ `height` ≤ `HEIGHT_MAX`
- **And** IF valid, save to `UserProfile.height_cm`
- **And** Set `calibration_start_date` = TODAY
- **And** Set `status` = "Calibrating"

**Scenario 09: Invalid Height Input**
- **Given** User enters height = 10 inches (below `HEIGHT_MIN`)
- **When** User taps "Confirm"
- **Then** Show inline error: *"Height must be between 1'9.5\" and 8'11\". Please check your entry."*
- **And** Do NOT proceed until valid input provided

**Scenario 10: User Changes Height (Post-Calibration)**
- **Given** User has completed 14-day calibration (`status` = "Active")
- **When** User changes height in Settings by > 2 cm
- **Then** Show warning modal: *"Changing your height will reset your baseline. You'll receive new insights in 14 days. Continue?"*
- **And** IF user confirms:
  - Reset `calibration_start_date` = TODAY
  - Set `status` = "Calibrating"
  - Archive previous `DailyWellnessRange` entries (for potential future analysis)
  - Send notification: *"Personal Health Agent is relearning your baseline."*

**Error Handling:**
- IF user enters height in feet/inches and conversion causes floating point error, round to nearest 0.1 cm

---

#### **FR-05: Signal Quality & Data Hygiene**

**Category:** Sensing

**Requirement:**
As a system, I must discard low-quality PPG data to prevent garbage-in-garbage-out algorithm failures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 11: Low Signal Quality Discard**
- **Given** PPG packet arrives with `signal_quality_index` (SQI) = 0.3
- **When** Preprocessing pipeline evaluates packet
- **Then** Discard packet (do not pass to inference)
- **And** Log event: `low_quality_signal_discarded` with timestamp
- **And** Do NOT count this packet toward daily valid wear time

**Scenario 12: Physiologically Implausible HR Discard**
- **Given** PPG-derived heart rate = 220 bpm (above `HR_MAX`)
- **When** Preprocessing evaluates
- **Then** Discard packet (likely motion artifact)
- **And** Log event: `implausible_hr_discarded`

**Scenario 13: Flat Line Identification (Watch Not Worn)**
- **Given** PPG signal shows zero variance for > 10 consecutive minutes
- **When** Preprocessing evaluates
- **Then** Mark entire 10-minute window as invalid (watch not worn properly)
- **And** Do NOT count toward daily wear time

**Error Handling:**
- IF > 50% of a day's PPG packets are discarded, mark day as `invalid_day` even if nominal wear time > 12 hours

---

#### **FR-06: The LLM Insight Engine (Guardian Voice)**

**Category:** AI/LLM

**Requirement:**
As a system, I must generate empathetic, contextual insights using an LLM to explain wellness range patterns in human language, maintaining the voice of Google Personal Health Agent.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 14: Weekly Summary Insight Generation**
- **Given** `WeeklySummary` data: `range_status = "Stable"`, `avg_sleep_hours = 7.5`, `prev_avg_sleep_hours = 6.8`
- **When** Generating weekly summary text
- **Then** Call Gemini API with prompt template:
  ```
  You are Google Personal Health Agent, a caring wellness coach. Generate a 1-2 sentence insight explaining this week's wellness range.

  Context:
  - Range status: Stable
  - Average sleep this week: 7.5 hours (up from 6.8 hours last week)
  - Average steps: 8200 (similar to last week)

  Tone: Warm, empowering, non-judgmental. Avoid medical terms.
  ```
- **And** LLM returns: *"Your range was stable last week. Your improved sleep (avg 7.5 hrs, up from 6.8 hrs) may have helped maintain your wellness range."*
- **And** Display this text in the weekly summary card

**Scenario 15: Persistent Elevation Insight Generation**
- **Given** Persistent elevation identified with correlations: sleep ↓ 45 min/night, stress events ↑ 3x
- **When** Generating persistent elevation notification text
- **Then** Call Gemini API with prompt emphasizing empathy and actionable context
- **And** LLM returns: *"I've noticed your wellness range has been elevated for 4 weeks. This could be related to recent changes in sleep (down 45 min/night) and stress. Let's explore what might help."*

**Error Handling:**
- IF Gemini API fails (timeout, 500 error), fallback to template-based text:
  - "Your range was [stable/elevated] last week."
- IF LLM generates prohibited terms ("hypertension," "diagnosis"), reject output and retry with stronger prompt constraints

---

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-01: Data Freshness**
- Dashboard must reflect Day T data by 08:00 AM local time on Day T+1 (99th percentile latency)

**NFR-02: API Latency**
- Weekly summary generation: < 500ms (p95)
- Persistent elevation check: < 1000ms (p95)

**NFR-03: Data Retention**
- Store `DailyWellnessRange` entries for 2 years (regulatory + user historical trends)
- Store raw PPG tokens for 90 days (algorithm improvement, then purge for privacy)

**NFR-04: Privacy**
- All PHI (wellness range data) encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- User can export or delete all data via Health app Settings

## 11. Regulatory Guardrails (UI/UX Constraints)

To maintain General Wellness classification (FDA Enforcement Discretion), the following constraints are **mandatory** in all user-facing surfaces:

### Visual Design Constraints

1. **❌ NO Red Colors**
   - Elevated range must use **amber/yellow** or **blue** (calm, not alarm)
   - Rationale: Red signals medical urgency, incompatible with general wellness positioning

2. **❌ NO Absolute BP Numbers**
   - Never display "135/85 mmHg"
   - Instead: "Your range was elevated" or "Probability: 0.72" (if showing raw score)
   - Rationale: Absolute values imply medical-grade measurement

3. **✅ REQUIRED: Disclaimers**
   - Every screen showing wellness range data must include footer text:
     *"This is not a medical device. For medical advice, consult a healthcare provider."*
   - Onboarding must include:
     *"Health Guardian is a general wellness tool. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease."*

4. **❌ NO Diagnostic Thresholds Labeling**
   - Do not label ranges as "Hypertensive" or "Stage 1 Hypertension"
   - Instead: "Out of general wellness range"

### Language Constraints (Prohibited Terms)

**NEVER use:**
- Monitor / Monitoring
- Diagnose / Diagnosis
- Detect / Detection
- Medical Grade / Clinically Accurate
- Hypertension / High Blood Pressure (as a condition user "has")
- Treatment / Treat
- Screen / Screening

**ALWAYS use:**
- General Wellness
- Educational / Informational
- Out of Range / Elevated Wellness Range
- Peace of Mind
- Health Patterns / Trends
- Lifestyle Awareness

### Notification Constraints

1. **Persistent Elevation Notifications:**
   - ✅ Allowed: *"Your wellness range has been elevated for 4 weeks. Consider talking to a healthcare provider."*
   - ❌ Prohibited: *"You may have hypertension. See a doctor immediately."*

2. **No Ongoing Alerts:**
   - Do NOT send daily alerts if range remains elevated
   - One notification per 30-day window maximum (with cooldown period)

### Export / Sharing Constraints

1. **PDF Exports for Healthcare Providers:**
   - ✅ Can include: Trend graphs, lifestyle correlations, dates
   - ❌ Cannot include: Clinical terminology, treatment recommendations
   - Must include disclaimer: *"This data is from a general wellness tool, not a medical device."*
