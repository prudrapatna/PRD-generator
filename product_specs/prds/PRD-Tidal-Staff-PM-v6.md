## 1. TL;DR

**Google Personal Health Agent** transforms your Pixel Watch into an intelligent cardiovascular wellness coach that not only makes the invisible visible—revealing blood pressure patterns you cannot feel—but actively guides you to reverse elevated ranges through personalized lifestyle interventions. For the 20 million young adults (18-44) walking around with undetected elevated blood pressure, thinking they're invincible, this is the wake-up call that comes with a roadmap: see the pattern, understand the cause, take action, and watch your range return to baseline—all without a doctor's appointment, a prescription, or the anxiety of medicalization.

## 2. Strategic Context

### Mission Alignment: The Personal Health Agent Revolution

Google Health exists to democratize preventive healthcare by making advanced health monitoring accessible, affordable, and anxiety-free for everyone. **Personal Health Agent** advances this mission by transforming the relationship between users and their cardiovascular wellness—from passive awareness to **active reversal**.

Here's the breakthrough: **Elevated blood pressure is reversible through lifestyle change.** Research shows that improving sleep quality (7+ hours), reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, and managing stress can bring blood pressure back to healthy ranges in 70%+ of cases—without medication. But most people never get the chance to try because they don't know they're elevated until it's a medical crisis.

We're changing that. For the first time, a **Personal Health Agent**—not a doctor, not a device, but an intelligent companion—makes the invisible visible, then guides you toward the specific lifestyle changes that research shows can reverse your elevated range. This is not monitoring. This is **active intervention** through personalized coaching, delivered with the gentleness of a friend and the rigor of clinical science.

**The Young Adult Crisis:** This matters most for the 20 million young adults (18-44) with undetected elevated blood pressure. They're not "old enough" to worry. They feel fine. They're building careers, raising families, living full lives—unaware that silent cardiovascular stress is accumulating. By the time symptoms appear (chest pain, stroke), decades of damage have occurred. We're reaching them now, in their 30s and 40s, when lifestyle interventions have maximum impact and decades of health to protect.

### Market Positioning: The Personal Health Agent Category

We are defining a new category: **Personal Health Agent for Cardiovascular Wellness**. This is not "blood pressure monitoring" (medical device positioning). This is not "cuff replacement" (competing with Omron). This is not even "passive tracking" (wearables status quo).

This is the first **agentic system** for cardiovascular wellness—an intelligent companion that detects invisible patterns, predicts lifestyle impact, and actively guides users to reverse elevated ranges through personalized interventions. Competitors give you numbers. We give you a roadmap to change them.

**Competitive Moat:**
- **Detect + Guide + Reverse:** Only system that closes the loop from detection → lifestyle guidance → range normalization (vs. competitors' "here's your number, good luck")
- **Passive + Calibration-Free:** Zero user effort for detection (vs. Samsung's monthly calibration burden)
- **ABPM Validation Standard:** Gold-standard ground truth capturing 24-hour patterns including sleep (vs. Apple's home BP baseline which misses nocturnal hypertension)
- **Longitudinal Intelligence:** 30-day analysis windows distinguish sustained patterns from temporary stress spikes
- **Predictive World Model:** Multi-horizon prediction showing users "if I sleep more, my range improves" with 80% probability (vs. competitors' reactive logbooks)
- **Personalized Lifestyle Coaching:** AI-powered sleep, stress, and activity interventions tailored to your patterns (vs. generic advice)

### Success at Scale

If we achieve 15% penetration of the Pixel Watch user base (5M users), we will identify an estimated 500,000 individuals with undetected cardiovascular risk. At population scale (50M wearers), we can bridge the awareness gap for millions—enabling early interventions that prevent strokes, heart attacks, and the billions in downstream healthcare costs from unmanaged hypertension.

More importantly, we will have proven that **general wellness technology**, when designed with clinical rigor, can deliver public health impact without the burden of medical device regulation—making preventive care universally accessible.

## 3. Intended Use (Regulatory North Star)

**Source:** FDA General Wellness Guidance (January 2026), Example 7

The Blood Pressure Notification feature is a **general wellness tool** intended to estimate blood pressure values and trends for **informational and educational purposes only**. It is designed to promote positive lifestyle behavior changes in sleep, activity, nutrition, and stress management by educating users and helping them understand how their daily habits correlate with estimated blood pressure range.

**Lifestyle Intervention Component:**
The feature provides personalized coaching and guidance on lifestyle choices which, as part of a healthy lifestyle, may help bring cardiovascular wellness range back to baseline. This includes:
- Sleep improvement coaching and tracking
- Stress management techniques and breathing exercises
- Activity recommendations based on individual patterns
- Educational content on how lifestyle factors influence cardiovascular wellness

The feature provides notifications when values fall outside of general wellness ranges to prompt users to reflect on their habits, engage with personalized lifestyle coaching, or consider evaluation by a healthcare professional if patterns persist. It is **not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition**, including hypertension.

**Clinical Context:**
Research demonstrates that lifestyle interventions (improved sleep, reduced sodium, increased activity, stress management) can support cardiovascular wellness in individuals with elevated blood pressure ranges. This feature educates users on these well-established associations and helps them implement such choices as part of a healthy lifestyle.

**Regulatory Classification:** General Wellness (FDA Enforcement Discretion - Non-Invasive, Low Risk, Validated Output)

**Contraindications:**
- Not intended for use during pregnancy (hemodynamic changes invalidate algorithm assumptions)
- Not intended for users with known cardiac arrhythmias requiring management
- Not intended as a substitute for clinical blood pressure measurement or home blood pressure devices

**What This Means for Users:**
This feature helps you understand the relationship between your lifestyle choices and your cardiovascular wellness range. It is not a medical device, and it does not replace advice or devices prescribed by your healthcare provider. If you receive persistent notifications, we recommend consulting a healthcare professional to understand your full cardiovascular health picture.

## 4. The Press Release (Narrative)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Google Announces "Personal Health Agent": Making the Invisible Visible, the Reversible Possible**

**MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA** — Today, Google introduces **Personal Health Agent**, a revolutionary AI-powered wellness companion for Pixel Watch and Radiance that not only makes blood pressure patterns you cannot feel visible through continuous, passive intelligence—but actively guides you to reverse elevated ranges through personalized lifestyle interventions, targeting the 20 million young adults who have no idea they're at risk.

### The Problem: The Invisible Threat Robbing Young Adults of Decades

High blood pressure is called "The Silent Killer" for a reason: you cannot feel it. No headaches. No warning signs. No sense of urgency. It exists entirely in the invisible realm of your body's physiology—rising and falling throughout the day and night without ever making itself known.

This invisibility has devastating consequences. **60 million Americans** have uncontrolled hypertension and don't know it. Among young adults (18-44), the awareness gap is catastrophic: **20 million people**—in their 30s and 40s, building careers, raising families, at the peak of their lives—are walking around with dangerous cardiovascular stress, completely unaware. They feel fine. They think they're invincible. They have no reason to check.

But here's what's happening silently: their arteries are stiffening. Their hearts are working overtime. Micro-damage is accumulating. By the time symptoms appear—chest pain, stroke, heart attack—decades of health have been stolen. And the cruelest part? **It didn't have to happen.** Elevated blood pressure in young adults is overwhelmingly lifestyle-driven and reversible through sleep improvement, stress management, and activity changes. But they never get the chance to reverse it because they don't know it's there.

The tragedy is not that blood pressure measurement is impossible. It's that the current system requires active effort (cuffs, calibration, doctor visits, medical anxiety), so young, healthy-feeling people don't check. And what is invisible remains invisible—until it's too late.

### The Solution: A Personal Health Agent That Guides You to Reverse It

**Personal Health Agent** changes everything. There is no cuff. There is no calibration. There is no doctor visit. You simply wear your watch, and your personal agent watches over you—then helps you take action.

Using advanced photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors and Google's novel **Waveform Foundation Model**—a deep learning system trained on the "song" of millions of heartbeats—your agent learns the unique rhythm of your blood flow. It watches in the background, day and night, building a longitudinal picture of your cardiovascular wellness range across weeks and months.

But here's the breakthrough: **it doesn't stop at detection.** When your agent notices your range has been elevated for 4 weeks, it doesn't just alarm you. It becomes your coach. It analyzes your sleep patterns, stress windows, activity levels, and recovery data to identify the specific lifestyle factors driving your elevated range. Then it guides you—with empathy, with personalization, with evidence—toward the changes most likely to bring your range back to baseline.

*"Your range has been elevated for 4 weeks. I've noticed your sleep dropped from 7.5 hours to 6.2 hours during this period. Research shows sleep improvement can normalize cardiovascular wellness range in 70% of cases. Let's try a 14-day Sleep Coaching plan tailored to your schedule. Ready?"*

This is the difference between a sensor and an agent. Between awareness and action. Between knowing you're at risk and actually reversing it.

**The 7-Star Experience: Invisible Protection, Visible Peace of Mind**

- **The Invisible Setup:** You put on your watch. That's it. No onboarding flow. No calibration ritual. While you live your life, the system quietly learns your baseline over 14 days. You get a single notification: "Health Guardian is learning your baseline. You'll receive your first insights next Monday."

- **The Reassuring Glance:** Every Monday morning, you wake up to a "Weekly Range" card. It doesn't show you numbers—just a simple, calming visualization: "Your range was stable last week." Below it, the system highlights what likely contributed: "Your improved sleep (avg 7.5 hrs, up from 6.8) may have helped maintain your wellness range."

- **The Personal Coach:** If life gets hectic and your range drifts persistently for a month, your agent doesn't alarm you. It doesn't use red colors or clinical terms. Instead, it becomes your coach, offering a personalized path forward: "I've noticed your range has been elevated for 4 weeks. This correlates with your sleep dropping to 6.2 hrs/night (down from 7.5 hrs). Research shows improving sleep brings cardiovascular wellness range back to baseline in 70% of cases within 2-4 weeks. Let's try a personalized 14-day Sleep Coaching plan. I'll guide you step by step."

- **The Reversal Journey:** You accept the coaching plan. Over 14 days, your agent sends gentle daily prompts: "Try a 10-minute wind-down routine tonight," "Your bedtime consistency improved 40% this week—great work." After 2 weeks, you see the result: "Your range returned to stable. Your sleep averaged 7.4 hrs during coaching (up from 6.2 hrs). This is what making the invisible visible—and the reversible possible—looks like."

This is not a medical device barking orders. This is not a passive sensor logging data. This is a **Personal Health Agent**—making what was invisible visible, what was ignored actionable, and what felt permanent reversible.

### Why This Matters: The World Model Difference

Most wearables are logbooks. They record. They report. They say "here's your number."

Health Guardian is different. It is a **World Model**—a simulation of your physiology that understands cause and effect. It doesn't just tell you your range shifted; it explains *why* by correlating it with sleep quality, activity patterns, stress windows, and recovery metrics. It predicts: "If you increase sleep by 60 minutes, there's an 80% probability your range stabilizes within 7 days."

This is the difference between a sensor and a coach. Between reactive monitoring and proactive guidance. Between data and understanding.

### What We're Building

**Internal Quote:**
*"For decades, blood pressure awareness has been locked behind clinical gates—white coats, cuffs, and the privilege of proactive healthcare. Personal Health Agent democratizes not just awareness, but reversal. We're proving that AI agents can guide people to change their cardiovascular health through lifestyle, not medication. For 20 million young adults who have no idea they're at risk, this is the intervention that comes decades early—when it can still change the trajectory of their lives. We're not trying to replace doctors. We're replacing the decades of silent damage that happen before people ever see one."* — VP, Google Health

**Customer Quote:**
*"I'm 36. I felt invincible. Then my Personal Health Agent showed me my range had been elevated for 5 weeks—I had no idea. But here's what changed my life: it didn't just tell me I had a problem. It showed me the cause (my sleep had dropped to 6 hours after my daughter was born) and gave me a plan to fix it. I did the 14-day Sleep Coaching. My range came back to baseline. I reversed it—no doctor, no medication, just sleep. That's when I realized: this isn't a tracker. It's a partner. And it gave me back decades of health I didn't know I was losing."* — Marcus, 36, Early Tester

### Get Started

Personal Health Agent will be available on Pixel Watch 3 and Radiance starting Q3 2026 as part of the Google Health app (no additional subscription required). Simply wear your watch, and your agent begins working for you automatically.

## 6. Problem & Opportunity

### The Invisibility Crisis

Blood pressure is fundamentally imperceptible. Unlike pain, fatigue, or shortness of breath—symptoms that create urgency—high blood pressure exists in silence. You cannot feel your systolic pressure at 145 mmHg versus 120 mmHg. Your body gives no warning until the damage is done.

This invisibility drives a catastrophic awareness gap:

- **50% of Americans** have hypertension
- **~60-70% of young adults (18-44)** with uncontrolled hypertension are unaware
- **20 million people** are walking around with dangerous cardiovascular stress, oblivious
- By the time symptoms appear (chest pain, stroke, heart attack), irreversible damage has occurred

### Why the Status Quo Fails: The "Active Effort" Barrier

Current solutions require active, intentional effort:

- **Office Blood Pressure:** Infrequent (annual visits at best), prone to "White Coat Hypertension" (anxiety-induced false highs)
- **Home Cuffs:** Require purchasing hardware, remembering to use it 2x/day for 5-7 days, enduring the squeeze, and interpreting results
- **Ambulatory Monitors (ABPM):** Gold standard but requires clinical prescription, 24-hour cuff wear, and medical interpretation

The result? The "invincible" young demographic—those most at risk from decades of undetected hypertension—simply don't check. Why would you, when you feel fine?

### The Google Health Differentiation: Passive Intelligence

We are not trying to replace cuffs or compete with medical devices. We are solving a different problem: **bridging the awareness gap through passive, longitudinal intelligence.**

**Our Unique Approach:**

1. **Passive Sensing:** No user action required. Data collection happens in the background during normal wear.
2. **Calibration-Free:** No setup burden (vs. Samsung's monthly cuff calibration requirement).
3. **Longitudinal Analysis:** 30-day rolling windows distinguish sustained patterns from temporary spikes (one stressful meeting ≠ hypertension).
4. **ABPM Ground Truth:** We validate against 24-hour ambulatory monitoring (gold standard) which captures nocturnal dipping and true variability, unlike competitors using home BP (waking hours only).
5. **World Model Reasoning:** Multi-horizon prediction showing users the relationship between lifestyle choices (sleep, stress, activity) and cardiovascular wellness range.

## 6. Validation & Competitive Rigor

### Target Performance (The Benchmark)

Our goal is to demonstrate **non-inferiority to Office Blood Pressure** measurement when both are compared to the gold standard: 24-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM).

**Clinical Context:**
Office BP is the current standard of care for hypertension screening, yet it has well-documented limitations (White Coat Effect, single time-point measurement). The USPSTF systematic review (Guirguis-Blake et al., JAMA 2021) established Office BP performance against ABPM:

| Metric | **Office BP Benchmark** | **Source** |
|:-------|:----------------------|:-----------|
| **Sensitivity** | 54% (95% CI: 37%, 70%) | USPSTF Review vs. ABPM |
| **Specificity** | 90% (95% CI: 84%, 95%) | USPSTF Review vs. ABPM |

Our target is comparability to this benchmark—not perfection, but clinical relevance.

---

### Current Performance (Tidal V1 Algorithm)

**Internal Validation Study (N=663):**

| Metric | **Tidal V1 Performance** | **Target Benchmark** | **Status** |
|:-------|:----------------------|:--------------------|:-----------|
| **Sensitivity** | 53% (95% CI: 40%, 64%) | 54% (95% CI: 37%, 70%) | ✅ **On Track** (Within CI) |
| **Specificity** | 93% (95% CI: 86%, 96%) | 90% (95% CI: 84%, 95%) | ✅ **Exceeds Target** |
| **Ground Truth** | 24-Hour ABPM | 24-Hour ABPM | ✅ **Gold Standard** |

**What This Means:**
- **Sensitivity (53%):** Of users with sustained elevated BP (confirmed by ABPM), we correctly identify 53%—comparable to Office BP (54%).
- **Specificity (93%):** Of users with normal BP, we correctly classify 93% as "in range"—*better* than Office BP (90%), meaning fewer false alarms.

**Transparency Note:**
Our sensitivity is not 90%+. We are not perfect. But we are comparable to the clinical standard (Office BP) while being *passive and continuous*—capturing patterns Office BP misses (nocturnal hypertension, day-to-day variability). This is the trade-off we make to democratize access.

---

### Validation Plan (The Pivotal Study)

To confirm performance at scale, we are conducting a multi-site clinical study:

**Study Design:**
- **Sample Size:** N=1,600 participants
- **Demographics:** Representative US population (age, sex, BMI, skin tone per Fitzpatrick scale)
- **Ground Truth:** 24-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) for all participants
- **Endpoints:** Sensitivity and specificity for identifying sustained elevated BP (SBP ≥130 or DBP ≥80 over 14+ days)
- **Subgroup Analyses:** Performance stratified by age, BMI, skin tone to ensure equity

**Objective:** Demonstrate statistical non-inferiority to Office BP for identifying sustained elevated blood pressure.

**Timeline:**
- Q2 2026: Study initiation
- Q4 2026: Data lock
- Q1 2027: Peer-reviewed publication

---

### Competitive Positioning Summary

**Where We Win:**
1. **Passive + Calibration-Free:** No user burden (Apple shares this, Samsung does not)
2. **Gold Standard Validation:** ABPM captures 24-hour patterns including nocturnal dipping—Apple and Samsung validate only against waking home BP
3. **Longitudinal Intelligence:** 30-day analysis windows vs. spot-check mentality
4. **World Model Reasoning:** Predicts lifestyle impact on range vs. reactive logging

**Where Competitors Win:**
1. **Medical Device Claims:** Apple/Samsung can use terms like "blood pressure monitoring," we cannot (regulatory trade-off for accessibility)
2. **Absolute Values:** Samsung/Omron provide numerical readings (120/80), we provide ranges (regulatory constraint for general wellness)

**Strategic Choice:**
We accept the constraint of general wellness positioning because it unlocks accessibility without prescription barriers. Our target user (Proactive Adopter) wants awareness, not diagnosis. Peace of mind, not medical management.

## 7. App Overview (The 7-Star Mobile Experience)

**Philosophy:** The wearable is the sensor. The phone is the product. All user-facing intelligence, insights, and interactions happen in the mobile app.

### The Health World Model

We are building beyond reactive monitoring—we are creating a **World Model** of the user's cardiovascular health.

**What is a World Model?**
A simulation of the user's physiology that understands cause-and-effect relationships. It learns:
- *"When this user sleeps 7+ hours, their wellness range stabilizes within 3 days"*
- *"Stress events (detected via HRV drops) correlate with 5-7 day range elevations"*
- *"Increased walking (8k+ steps/day) corresponds to 10% lower vascular stiffness proxy"*

**Multi-Horizon Prediction:**
The system doesn't just report the past; it predicts the future. Users can ask (or the system proactively suggests): *"If I prioritize sleep this week, what happens to my range?"* The model runs a shadow simulation and answers with probability: *"80% chance your range returns to baseline within 7 days."*

**Cost Function (The Path of Least Resistance):**
The system assigns a "biological cost" to user choices. It surfaces the interventions with the highest impact and lowest effort:
- *"A 10-minute walk costs you 10 minutes but improves vascular recovery 15%. A 60-minute nap costs 60 minutes but improves recovery 8%."*

This is not about nagging users. It's about giving them agency through intelligence.

---

### Mobile Experience Flow

#### **Phase 1: The Invisible Setup (Day 0-14)**

**User Action:** Enable Health Guardian during watch setup or in Health App settings.

**System Behavior:**
1. User taps "Enable Guardian"
2. System prompts for **Height** (mandatory—critical for algorithm accuracy)
3. Confirmation screen: *"Health Guardian is learning your baseline. Wear your watch as usual. You'll receive your first insights in 14 days."*

**Design Note:**
No progress bars. No daily updates. No anxiety-inducing "calibration mode." The system works invisibly. Users forget about it until Monday morning.

---

#### **Phase 2: The Weekly Reassurance (Ongoing)**

**Cadence:** Every Monday morning, 8:00 AM local time.

**Notification:**
*"Your weekly wellness range is ready."*

**In-App Card:**
- **Visual:** Simple gauge showing "Stable" or "Elevated" (no numbers, no red colors)
- **Primary Message:** *"Your range was stable last week."*
- **Lifestyle Correlation:** *"Your improved sleep (avg 7.5 hrs, up from 6.8 hrs) may have helped maintain your wellness range."*
- **Trend Context:** Small line graph showing last 4 weeks (pattern recognition, not alarm)

**Interaction:** Tap to see detailed breakdown:
- Sleep quality by night
- Activity intensity by day
- Stress windows (HRV drops)
- Recovery scores

**Design Principles:**
- **Calm, not clinical:** Soft colors (blue/green), rounded shapes, human language
- **Context, not commands:** Explain *why* things happened, don't just report *what* happened
- **Empowerment, not judgment:** Celebrate progress, normalize variance

---

#### **Phase 3: The Caring Nudge (If Patterns Persist)**

**Trigger Logic:**
If user has ≥14 valid days in a rolling 30-day window, and ≥70% of those days show elevated wellness range (probability > threshold), system generates a persistent elevation notification.

**Notification:**
*"Your wellness range has been elevated for 4 weeks."*

**In-App Experience:**
- **Empathetic Opening:** *"I've noticed your wellness range has been elevated for 4 weeks. This isn't an emergency, but patterns like this can be worth exploring."*
- **Potential Factors:** System highlights correlations (e.g., sleep decreased by 45 min/night, stress events increased 3x)
- **Actionable Paths (User Choice):**
  1. *"Start a 14-Day Sleep Coaching Plan"* (Guided intervention within app)
  2. *"Review My Lifestyle Patterns"* (Detailed correlation analysis)
  3. *"Talk to a Healthcare Provider"* (Export summary PDF for doctor visit)

**What We Don't Do:**
- ❌ No red colors or alarms
- ❌ No diagnostic language ("You may have hypertension")
- ❌ No absolute BP numbers
- ❌ No ongoing daily alerts (respects user attention)

### Structured Functional Requirements (Gherkin Format)

#### **FR-01: Sensing & Data Ingestion (Day-Late Cadence)**

**Category:** Sensing

**Requirement:**
As a system, I must ensure data completeness by processing PPG data in overnight batch jobs, accepting a "day-late" view for accuracy over real-time presentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 01: Overnight Data Processing**
- **Given** User wears watch on Day T with ≥12 hours of valid wear time
- **When** Nightly batch processing runs at Day T+1 (02:00 AM local time)
- **Then** PPG data for Day T is ingested, tokenized, and uploaded to cloud
- **And** Inference pipeline generates `DailyWellnessRange` entry for Day T
- **And** Data becomes visible in app by 08:00 AM Day T+1
- **And** NO partial/incomplete data is shown for Day T+1 (prevents user confusion)

**Scenario 02: Insufficient Wear Time**
- **Given** User wears watch on Day T for only 8 hours
- **When** Nightly processing runs
- **Then** Day T is marked as `invalid_day` (wear time < MIN_WEAR_DURATION)
- **And** No `DailyWellnessRange` entry is created
- **And** Day T does not count toward weekly or monthly valid day thresholds

**Error Handling:**
- IF processing pipeline fails, retry 3x with exponential backoff
- IF failure persists > 48 hours, show in-app banner: *"Data processing delayed. We're working on it."*
- Log failure to monitoring dashboard with alert to on-call SRE

---

#### **FR-02: Weekly Reactive View (Monday Morning Summary)**

**Category:** Logic

**Requirement:**
As a user, I want a reactive weekly summary of my wellness range so I can understand patterns without daily interruption.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 03: Generate Weekly Summary (Sufficient Data)**
- **Given** User has ≥7 valid days in the last 7-day window (Mon-Sun)
- **When** It is Monday at 08:00 AM local time
- **Then** Generate `WeeklySummary` entry
- **And** Calculate `range_status`:
  - IF < 30% of days have `probability_elevated` > `HTN_THRESHOLD` → "Stable"
  - ELSE → "Elevated"
- **And** Correlate with lifestyle data:
  - `avg_sleep_hours` = AVG(sleep duration for valid days)
  - `avg_steps` = AVG(step count for valid days)
  - `avg_hrv` = AVG(HRV for valid days)
- **And** Send push notification: *"Your weekly wellness range is ready."*

**Scenario 04: Insufficient Data for Weekly View**
- **Given** User has < 7 valid days in the last 7-day window
- **When** It is Monday at 08:00 AM
- **Then** NO push notification is sent
- **And** In-app card shows: *"Wear your watch more consistently to see weekly insights. You had X valid days this week (need 7)."*

**Error Handling:**
- IF `avg_sleep_hours` or `avg_steps` data unavailable (user disabled Fitbit integration), show generic summary without lifestyle correlation

---

#### **FR-03: Persistent Elevation Detection (Monthly Proactive Check)**

**Category:** Logic

**Requirement:**
As a system, I must detect sustained elevated wellness range patterns over 30 days to notify users of persistent shifts worth exploring.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 05: Persistent Elevation Detected**
- **Given** User has ≥14 valid days in the last 30-day rolling window
- **And** COUNT(days where `probability_elevated` > `HTN_THRESHOLD`) / 14 ≥ 0.70 (70%)
- **When** Monthly check runs (every Monday at 08:05 AM)
- **Then** Create `PersistentElevationNotification` entry
- **And** Send push notification: *"Your wellness range has been elevated for 4 weeks."*
- **And** In-app experience shows:
  - Empathetic context: *"Patterns like this can be worth exploring."*
  - Lifestyle correlations: Highlight changes in sleep, stress, activity
  - Action options: [Sleep Coaching] [Review Patterns] [Talk to Provider]

**Scenario 06: Borderline Case (69% of days elevated)**
- **Given** User has 14 valid days, 9 elevated (64%)
- **When** Monthly check runs
- **Then** NO persistent elevation notification sent (threshold not met)
- **And** User sees normal weekly summaries (no alarm for transient variability)

**Scenario 07: User Already Notified (Cooldown Period)**
- **Given** User received a persistent elevation notification on Day T
- **And** Current date is Day T+21 (within 30-day cooldown)
- **When** Monthly check runs and criteria still met
- **Then** NO new notification sent (prevent notification fatigue)
- **And** In-app card remains accessible for user to review

**Error Handling:**
- IF calculation ambiguous (e.g., exactly 70.0% due to floating point), round down (favor NOT notifying to avoid false alarms)

---

#### **FR-04: User Profile & Height Management**

**Category:** User Profile

**Requirement:**
As a system, I must enforce valid height input and reset calibration when height changes, as height is a critical feature for algorithm accuracy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 08: Valid Height Input**
- **Given** User is in onboarding flow or Settings > Health Guardian
- **When** User enters height
- **Then** Validate: `HEIGHT_MIN` ≤ `height` ≤ `HEIGHT_MAX`
- **And** IF valid, save to `UserProfile.height_cm`
- **And** Set `calibration_start_date` = TODAY
- **And** Set `status` = "Calibrating"

**Scenario 09: Invalid Height Input**
- **Given** User enters height = 10 inches (below `HEIGHT_MIN`)
- **When** User taps "Confirm"
- **Then** Show inline error: *"Height must be between 1'9.5\" and 8'11\". Please check your entry."*
- **And** Do NOT proceed until valid input provided

**Scenario 10: User Changes Height (Post-Calibration)**
- **Given** User has completed 14-day calibration (`status` = "Active")
- **When** User changes height in Settings by > 2 cm
- **Then** Show warning modal: *"Changing your height will reset your baseline. You'll receive new insights in 14 days. Continue?"*
- **And** IF user confirms:
  - Reset `calibration_start_date` = TODAY
  - Set `status` = "Calibrating"
  - Archive previous `DailyWellnessRange` entries (for potential future analysis)
  - Send notification: *"Health Guardian is relearning your baseline."*

**Error Handling:**
- IF user enters height in feet/inches and conversion causes floating point error, round to nearest 0.1 cm

---

#### **FR-05: Signal Quality & Data Hygiene**

**Category:** Sensing

**Requirement:**
As a system, I must discard low-quality PPG data to prevent garbage-in-garbage-out algorithm failures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 11: Low Signal Quality Discard**
- **Given** PPG packet arrives with `signal_quality_index` (SQI) = 0.3
- **When** Preprocessing pipeline evaluates packet
- **Then** Discard packet (do not pass to inference)
- **And** Log event: `low_quality_signal_discarded` with timestamp
- **And** Do NOT count this packet toward daily valid wear time

**Scenario 12: Physiologically Implausible HR Discard**
- **Given** PPG-derived heart rate = 220 bpm (above `HR_MAX`)
- **When** Preprocessing evaluates
- **Then** Discard packet (likely motion artifact)
- **And** Log event: `implausible_hr_discarded`

**Scenario 13: Flat Line Detection (Watch Not Worn)**
- **Given** PPG signal shows zero variance for > 10 consecutive minutes
- **When** Preprocessing evaluates
- **Then** Mark entire 10-minute window as invalid (watch not worn properly)
- **And** Do NOT count toward daily wear time

**Error Handling:**
- IF > 50% of a day's PPG packets are discarded, mark day as `invalid_day` even if nominal wear time > 12 hours

---

#### **FR-06: The LLM Insight Engine (Guardian Voice)**

**Category:** AI/LLM

**Requirement:**
As a system, I must generate empathetic, contextual insights using an LLM to explain wellness range patterns in human language.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 14: Weekly Summary Insight Generation**
- **Given** `WeeklySummary` data: `range_status = "Stable"`, `avg_sleep_hours = 7.5`, `prev_avg_sleep_hours = 6.8`
- **When** Generating weekly summary text
- **Then** Call Gemini API with prompt template:
  ```
  You are Health Guardian, a caring wellness coach. Generate a 1-2 sentence insight explaining this week's wellness range.

  Context:
  - Range status: Stable
  - Average sleep this week: 7.5 hours (up from 6.8 hours last week)
  - Average steps: 8200 (similar to last week)

  Tone: Warm, empowering, non-judgmental. Avoid medical terms.
  ```
- **And** LLM returns: *"Your range was stable last week. Your improved sleep (avg 7.5 hrs, up from 6.8 hrs) may have helped maintain your wellness range."*
- **And** Display this text in the weekly summary card

**Scenario 15: Persistent Elevation Insight Generation**
- **Given** Persistent elevation detected with correlations: sleep ↓ 45 min/night, stress events ↑ 3x
- **When** Generating persistent elevation notification text
- **Then** Call Gemini API with prompt emphasizing empathy and actionable context
- **And** LLM returns: *"I've noticed your wellness range has been elevated for 4 weeks. This could be related to recent changes in sleep (down 45 min/night) and stress. Let's explore what might help."*

**Error Handling:**
- IF Gemini API fails (timeout, 500 error), fallback to template-based text:
  - "Your range was [stable/elevated] last week."
- IF LLM generates prohibited terms ("hypertension," "diagnosis"), reject output and retry with stronger prompt constraints

---

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-01: Data Freshness**
- Dashboard must reflect Day T data by 08:00 AM local time on Day T+1 (99th percentile latency)

**NFR-02: API Latency**
- Weekly summary generation: < 500ms (p95)
- Persistent elevation check: < 1000ms (p95)

**NFR-03: Data Retention**
- Store `DailyWellnessRange` entries for 2 years (regulatory + user historical trends)
- Store raw PPG tokens for 90 days (algorithm improvement, then purge for privacy)

**NFR-04: Privacy**
- All PHI (wellness range data) encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- User can export or delete all data via Health app Settings

## 11. Regulatory Guardrails (UI/UX Constraints)

To maintain General Wellness classification (FDA Enforcement Discretion), the following constraints are **mandatory** in all user-facing surfaces:

### Visual Design Constraints

1. **❌ NO Red Colors**
   - Elevated range must use **amber/yellow** or **blue** (calm, not alarm)
   - Rationale: Red signals medical urgency, incompatible with general wellness positioning

2. **❌ NO Absolute BP Numbers**
   - Never display "135/85 mmHg"
   - Instead: "Your range was elevated" or "Probability: 0.72" (if showing raw score)
   - Rationale: Absolute values imply medical-grade measurement

3. **✅ REQUIRED: Disclaimers**
   - Every screen showing wellness range data must include footer text:
     *"This is not a medical device. For medical advice, consult a healthcare provider."*
   - Onboarding must include:
     *"Health Guardian is a general wellness tool. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease."*

4. **❌ NO Diagnostic Thresholds Labeling**
   - Do not label ranges as "Hypertensive" or "Stage 1 Hypertension"
   - Instead: "Out of general wellness range"

### Language Constraints (Prohibited Terms)

**NEVER use:**
- Monitor / Monitoring
- Diagnose / Diagnosis
- Detect / Detection
- Medical Grade / Clinically Accurate
- Hypertension / High Blood Pressure (as a condition user "has")
- Treatment / Treat
- Screen / Screening

**ALWAYS use:**
- General Wellness
- Educational / Informational
- Out of Range / Elevated Wellness Range
- Peace of Mind
- Health Patterns / Trends
- Lifestyle Awareness

### Notification Constraints

1. **Persistent Elevation Notifications:**
   - ✅ Allowed: *"Your wellness range has been elevated for 4 weeks. Consider talking to a healthcare provider."*
   - ❌ Prohibited: *"You may have hypertension. See a doctor immediately."*

2. **No Ongoing Alerts:**
   - Do NOT send daily alerts if range remains elevated
   - One notification per 30-day window maximum (with cooldown period)

### Export / Sharing Constraints

1. **PDF Exports for Healthcare Providers:**
   - ✅ Can include: Trend graphs, lifestyle correlations, dates
   - ❌ Cannot include: Clinical terminology, treatment recommendations
   - Must include disclaimer: *"This data is from a general wellness tool, not a medical device."*
