# Background and high level learning goals

Although blood pressure is a widely recognized health metric, it remains poorly managed for many individuals, leading to impacts on longevity across all age groups.
We are now developing a range of features which offer user insights into:
* Potential indicators of hypertension, a condition of which over half of those affected are unaware because it often lacks symptoms.
* The status of their inferred or estimated blood pressure, categorized as being in range, slightly out of range, or out of range.
* Variability of blood pressure relative to their personal baseline and absolute blood pressure with calibration
* The impact of various lifestyle elements, such as nutrition, physical activity, and sleep patterns, on their blood pressure levels.

Our aim with this offer is to:
* Increase awareness if a user is showing signs suggestive of hypertension so they can get screened and diagnosed.
* Enable users to make the right lifestyle choices to keep the blood pressure in the optimal range and in effect slow down the pace of aging, be in sync with their biological age.

# Decisions supported

The team needs to decide whether to continue with a Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) approach. This would be medically regulated.
Could a wellness approach promote blood pressure awareness and engage users into coaching. The experience would not directly tell the user they are at risk of hypertension (chronic medical condition for high blood pressure), only provide in range/out of range insights and highlighting the following:
* Highlight blood pressure estimates / trends
* Lifestyle factors/related behaviours that impact heart health
* Nudge people that consulting a health care expert might be helpful.

# High level learning goals

To support this decision, as part of the Tidal Clinical Trial approach, this study will assess the following in 2 wellness proposals and 1 SaMD proposal:

What are barriers and drivers to actionability and credibility In 2 wellness and 1 SaMD proposals for blood pressure monitoring features?

When it comes to actionability, why are people open of not to these next steps:
* Being screened by a doctor?
* Making lifestyle changes?
* Validating blood pressure notifications  with a cuff?

When it comes to credibility, why do the following factors drive credibility or not:
* FDA Clearance
* Published studies showing scientific validation
* Knowing what inputs are used to calculate blood pressure data
* Having clinical experts speak about the validity of the approach
* Publishing data on real-life use and impact
* Educational content on the correlation between lifestyle factors and blood pressure
