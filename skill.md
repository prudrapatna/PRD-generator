## Research Synthesis Skill

### Description
Use this skill to analyze and synthesize qualitative user research, including:
- survey responses
- customer feedback
- interview notes
- mixed qualitative datasets

Trigger this skill when asked to "analyze," "synthesize," or "find patterns" in user research.

### When to Use
- Analyze survey responses
- Synthesize customer interview notes
- Find patterns in feedback data
- Summarize user research findings
- Create research reports

### Output Framework
When synthesizing research, structure output in this order:

#### 1) Executive Summary
- 2–3 sentence overview of key findings
- The single most important insight

#### 2) Key Themes
For each theme identified, include:
- **Theme Name:** Clear, descriptive label
- **Frequency:** How many responses mentioned it (e.g., "12 of 20 respondents")
- **Representative Quotes:** 2–3 direct quotes that exemplify the theme
- **Implications:** What this means for the product or feature

#### 3) Quantitative Patterns
- Summary statistics (if applicable)
- Distribution of responses
- Notable segments or groupings

#### 4) Recommendations
- Prioritized list of actions based on findings
- Each recommendation tied to specific evidence
- Clear distinction between "must have" and "nice to have"

Use this format:
- **Must Have:** [Recommendation] — Based on [evidence]
- **Should Have:** [Recommendation] — Based on [evidence]
- **Could Have:** [Recommendation] — Based on [evidence]

#### 5) Open Questions
- Areas needing further research
- Conflicting signals that need resolution
- Assumptions to validate

Example open questions:
- Do enterprise users have different needs? (only 3 in sample)
- How does this compare to competitor offerings?

### Best Practices
- Quote liberally so users speak in their own words
- Keep recommendations explicitly evidence-linked
- Separate observed facts from interpretation
