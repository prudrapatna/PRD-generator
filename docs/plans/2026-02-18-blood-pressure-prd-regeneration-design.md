# Blood Pressure PRD Regeneration Design

**Date:** February 18, 2026
**Author:** Brainstorming Session
**Status:** Approved for Execution

## Objective

Regenerate the Google Health Guardian (Project Tidal) PRD to address critical gaps:
- ❌ Weak narrative and vision
- ❌ Disconnected sections
- ❌ Vague functional specifications
- ❌ Missing strategic context

## Approach: Narrative Thread Enhancement

Keep the existing PRD structure but transform the content quality through:

1. **Narrative Flow** - Each section references previous insights and tees up next questions
2. **Strategic Context** - Add mission alignment and market positioning
3. **Visionary Press Release** - Use 7-Star Experience methodology (Jobs/Chesky principles)
4. **Engineering-Ready Requirements** - Gherkin scenarios with quantifiable acceptance criteria
5. **Comprehensive Competitive Analysis** - Head-to-head comparison tables

## Core Philosophy

**Problem Framing:**
- NOT: "Cuffs are anxious/inconvenient" (we're not a replacement)
- INSTEAD: "Blood pressure changes are invisible and imperceptible"
- VALUE: "We make the invisible visible through passive background awareness"

**Product Philosophy:**
- Wearable = sensor (passive data collection)
- Phone = product (where the experience lives)
- We're not replacing doctors or cuffs, we're replacing anxiety with peace of mind

## Regulatory Constraints

**Prohibited Terms:** Monitor, Diagnose, Detect, Medical Grade, Condition, Hypertension, Treatment
**Required Terms:** General Wellness, Educational, Out of Range, Peace of Mind, Health Patterns

## PRD Structure (Following Orchestrator Agent)

1. TL;DR & Metadata
2. Strategic Context (NEW) - Mission alignment, positioning
3. Intended Use (Regulatory)
4. Press Release - 7-Star Experience, visionary narrative
5. Problem & Opportunity - Competitive analysis, validation plan
6. App Overview - Mobile-first 7-Star vision
7. Critical User Journeys - Mobile app only, Google CUJ Playbook format
8. Functional Requirements - Gherkin format, quantifiable
9. Technical Architecture
10. Regulatory Guardrails
11. Success Metrics - HEART framework

## Skills Utilized

- **product-narrative-skill.md** - For press release with 7-Star methodology
- **cuj-generator-skill.md** - For user journeys following Google CUJ Playbook
- **acceptance-criteria-skill.md** - For engineering-ready requirements

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Narrative flows naturally between sections (80%+ use core metaphor)
- ✅ Press release inspires and delights (visionary tone)
- ✅ Requirements are atomic, quantifiable, testable
- ✅ Engineers can implement without asking "how?"
- ✅ No prohibited regulatory terms used
- ✅ Strategic context clear (mission, positioning, differentiation)

**Next Step:** Generate the PRD following this design.
