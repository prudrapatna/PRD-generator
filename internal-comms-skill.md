## Guideline 1: 3P Updates (Progress, Plans, Problems)

**Audience:** Executives, leadership, teammates.
**Format Goal:** Succinct, read in 30-60sec.
**Scope:** Can range from a single team to the entire company.

### Structure
1.  **Progress:** What has been accomplished (shipped, milestones, tasks completed). Focus on the past week/period.
2.  **Plans:** Top-of-mind priorities for the next week/period.
3.  **Problems:** Blockers, resource constraints, lost deals, slowing factors.

### Information Gathering (Tools)
*   **Google Chat:** Search for team updates, "shipped" announcements, or blockers in team spaces.
*   **Google Drive:** Check for recent design docs, project trackers, or post-mortems.
*   **Gmail:** Look for status email threads.
*   **Calendar:** Check for key meetings like "Product Review" or "Launch Go/No-Go".

### Formatting
*Strict adherence required.* Pick a fun/relevant emoji.

`[Emoji] [Team Name] (Dates Covered)`
*   **Progress:** [1-3 sentences, data-driven, specific metrics]

## Guideline 2: Company Newsletter

**Audience:** Entire company.
**Format Goal:** 20-25 bullet points, consumable via Chat/Email.
**Tone:** "We" tense (inclusive), short and to-the-point (1-2 sentences per bullet).

### Content Strategy
*   **Prioritize:** Company-wide impact, leadership announcements, major milestones, external recognition.
*   **Avoid:** Granular team details (save for 3Ps), duplicates, restricted info.

### Information Gathering (Tools)
*   **Google Chat:** Look for highly reacted messages in `#announcements` or `#general` spaces.
*   **Gmail:** Search for emails from executives or "all-hands" recaps.
*   **Calendar:** Review "All-Hands" or "Town Hall" meeting attachments/notes.
*   **Google Drive:** Link to new vision docs, quarterly plans, or strategy decks.

### Sectioning
Group updates logically (e.g., Product, Business, People, News).

### Example Format
**:megaphone: Company Announcements**
*   Announcement 1
*   Announcement 2

**:dart: Progress on Priorities**
*   **Product Area**
    *   Shipped X feature
    *   Launched Y beta
*   **Business Area**
    *   Closed Z deal

**:pillar: Leadership Updates**
*   CEO update on strategy...

**:thread: Social & Culture**

**Audience:** All employees.
**Goal:** Clarify confusion on broad topics (benefits, changes, events).

### Information Gathering (Tools)
*   **Google Chat:** Search for question marks `?` in large spaces or threads with many replies.
*   **Gmail:** Look for "Q&A" threads or HR announcements.
*   **Google Drive:** Find official policy docs or FAQ documents linked in calendar invites.

### Formatting

## Guideline 4: General Internal Comms

**Use for:** Anything not covered above (Incident Reports, specific project updates, etc.).

### Workflow

2.  **Drafting Principles:**
    *   **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):** Most important info first.
    *   **Active Voice:** "We decided" vs "It was decided".
    *   **Concise:** Respect the reader's time.
    *   **Actionable:** Clear next steps or links.
