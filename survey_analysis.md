# User Research Synthesis: Blood Pressure Monitoring Features

**Date:** February 14, 2026
**Data Source:** 10 Simulated User Interviews
**Objective:** To assess user preference between Wellness vs. SaMD approaches and understand barriers/drivers to actionability.

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The user base is nearly evenly divided between preferring a **Wellness Approach (50%)** and a **Medical Device (SaMD) Approach (40%)**, with one user undecided. This split largely correlates with the user's existing health anxiety and technical literacy.

*   **Wellness preference** is driven by ease of use, lower anxiety, and "soft nudges."
*   **SaMD preference** is driven by a need for accuracy, FDA clearance, and data validity for medical conversations.

## 2. Preference Analysis: Wellness vs. SaMD

| Preference | Count | User Archetypes | Key Reasons |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Concept A (Wellness)** | 5 | Tech-Savvy, Anxious Avoider, Busy Pro, Fitness Enthusiast, "Ignorance is Bliss" | Less scary, easier to fit into routine, coaching focus, holistic view. |
| **Concept B (Medical)** | 4 | The Skeptic, Chronic Patient, Senior Citizen, Data Analyst | Need for hard proof, existing condition management, distrust of "toys", desire for doctor-ready data. |
| **Unsure** | 1 | Cost-Conscious | Depends on cost and insurance coverage. |

**Insight:** A "one-size-fits-all" approach may fail. The Wellness approach engages the "worried well" or avoidant users, while the SaMD approach is non-negotiable for those with existing conditions or high skepticism.

## 3. Barriers to Actionability
When users receive an "out of range" alert, they hesitate to see a doctor due to three main factors:

1.  **Uncertainty of Accuracy (40%):** Users want to verify the reading themselves before "bothering" a doctor. They fear false alarms.
2.  **Anxiety & Fear (40%):** A significant segment (The Anxious Avoider, Senior, "Ignorance is Bliss") is paralyzed by the fear of a diagnosis. Aggressive red alerts worsen this.
3.  **"Wait and See" Protocol (40%):** Many users prefer to wait and re-measure at home as a first defense, effectively delaying professional care.

## 4. Drivers for Validation (Cuff Usage)
What motivates a user to validate an app reading with a real cuff?

*   **Context is King:** For tech-savvy and engaged users, explaining *why* a reading is unusual (e.g., "your sleep was poor") is the top motivator.
*   **Symptom Correlation:** For avoidant or cost-conscious users, physical symptoms (headache, dizziness) are the only things that override their hesitation.
*   **Urgency & Instructions:** Clear, urgent flags and simple instructions help the elderly and skeptics take action.

## 5. Credibility Drivers
Different segments require different "proof" to trust the system:

*   **FDA Clearance:** Non-negotiable for The Skeptic, Senior, and Chronic Patient.
*   **Scientific Transparency:** The Data Analyst and Tech-Savvy users demand to know the inputs and see the studies.
*   **Soft Factors:** Success stories and educational content appeal more to the Busy Professional and Cost-Conscious users who are looking for lifestyle guidance rather than a medical tool.

## 6. Recommendations

1.  **Hybrid Experience:** Consider a tiered experience where the "Wellness" layer is the entry point (low anxiety, lifestyle focus), with an option to "unlock" or upgrade to a "Medical Grade" mode (SaMD) for users who need that rigour.
2.  **Contextual Alerts:** Alerts should not just be "High BP". They must provide context (e.g., "Your BP is elevated, which correlates with your low sleep score"). This drives validation.
3.  **Anxiety-Reducing UI:** For the wellness users, avoid "scary" medical reds. Use "soft nudges" as requested by the Anxious Avoider.
4.  **Verification Pathway:** Since "wait and re-measure" is a common behavior, build it into the flow. "We noticed a high reading. Let's guide you through a cuff check to confirm."
5.  **Data Export:** Essential for chronic patients. Ensure easy PDF export for doctor visits.
