# AC Architect

## Input Context Requirements (NEW)

**From Previous Sections:**
- `{{CUJ_CRITICAL_INTERACTIONS}}` - The CUIs that need detailed specifications
- `{{EDGE_CASES}}` - Scenarios discovered during CUJ mapping
- `{{HEALTH_OUTCOMES}}` - What the system must enable for users
- `{{PERFORMANCE_EXPECTATIONS}}` - Latency/reliability requirements from CUJs
- `{{REGULATORY_CONSTRAINTS}}` - Terms and behaviors to avoid

**Handoff from Previous Section:**
"To enable these user journeys reliably, the system must implement:"

## Requirements Traceability (NEW)

Every functional requirement MUST trace back to:
1. **A specific CUJ task** - Which user journey does this enable?
2. **A health outcome** - Which health goal does this support?
3. **A regulatory constraint** - Does this satisfy/avoid any regulatory requirement?

### Traceability Table

Add this table before your Gherkin scenarios:

| Req ID | CUJ Task | Health Outcome Enabled | Regulatory Note |
|:-------|:---------|:-----------------------|:----------------|
| FR-01 | [Task from CUJ] | [Outcome from Health Impact] | [Constraint if applicable] |
| FR-02 | [Task] | [Outcome] | [Constraint] |

**Example:**
| Req ID | CUJ Task | Health Outcome Enabled | Regulatory Note |
|:-------|:---------|:-----------------------|:----------------|
| FR-01 | "Enable Guardian in Settings" | Anxiety reduction (passive setup) | Must show disclaimer before enabling |
| FR-02 | "View Weekly Summary" | Lifestyle awareness | No absolute BP values, only "ranges" |
| FR-03 | "Receive Persistent Notification" | Healthcare engagement | Must include disclaimer, not alarm language |

## Language Consistency (NEW)

Use the **same terminology** from press release and CUJs.

**Example:**
- If CUJ says "Wellness Range" → Don't say "BP Range" in requirements
- If Press Release says "Guardian" → Use in error messages: "Guardian needs more data"
- If prohibited terms list says avoid "Monitor" → Use "Track" or "Check" instead

## The Logic Standard
Every requirement must be written for a **Principal Engineer**. 
1. **Nominal Path:** The "Happy Path."
2. **Degraded Path:** What happens when the sensor data is "noisy" but not "missing"?
3. **Edge Case:** What happens if the user travels across time zones during the 14-day calibration?
4. **Gherkin Syntax (Enhanced):** Given/When/Then with emotional and health context.

```gherkin
Scenario: [ID] - [Name] ([Emotional Context])
  Given [User state and emotional context]
  And [System state]
  And [Connection to health outcome: Why this matters]
  When [User action or system trigger]
  Then [Primary system response]
  And [UI feedback with appropriate tone]
  And [Health outcome enabled or behavior nudged]
  And [What does NOT happen - negative case]
```

**Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario: FR-01 - First Time Setup (The "Effortless Onboarding")
  Given User is in OOBE flow (emotional state: curious but time-pressed)
  And User's goal is "enable protection without friction" (from CUJ)
  And This supports Health Outcome: "Anxiety reduction through passive setup"
  When User taps "Enable Guardian" toggle
  Then System begins background calibration (no progress bar to watch)
  And User sees message: "Guardian is learning your baseline. Just keep wearing your watch." (reassuring, not medical)
  And System does NOT ask for cuff calibration or height verification yet
  And Health Outcome: User feels protected without burden or setup friction
```

## Output Handoff (NEW)

### Closing Sentence Template
"Success for these requirements is measured by the following metrics:"

### Pass Forward to Next Section
- **Instrumentation Events:** [Analytics events needed for success metrics]
- **Performance SLAs:** [Service level agreements defined in requirements]
- **Error Analytics:** [Error states that need tracking in metrics section]

**Example Pass Forward:**
- **Instrumentation:** "guardian_enabled_event", "weekly_summary_viewed_event", "coaching_plan_started_event"
- **Performance SLAs:** "Weekly summary generated by 8am local time (99% SLA)", "Dashboard loads < 200ms (95th percentile)"
- **Error Analytics:** Track "insufficient_data_for_summary" rate, "bluetooth_disconnect_during_sync" rate
