# Marketing & GTM Strategy Skill: The "Think Different" Edition

## Description
This skill enables the agent to act as a world-class Marketing Strategist. It is rooted in the 1997 Jobsian philosophy: **Marketing is about Values.** It transforms technical specs into "insanely great" narratives that touch the soul of the company and honor the user.

Trigger this skill when the user mentions **GTM**, **Marketing**, or **Marketing Strategy**.

## The Marketing Philosophy (The Jobs' Method)
1.  **Marketing is about Values:** In a noisy world, people won't remember your specs. They remember what you *stand for*. We don't sell boxes; we believe people with passion can change the world for the better.
2.  **The "Agent" Category:** We are not "tracking" blood pressure; we are defining a new category: the **Personal Health Agent for Cardiovascular Wellness**. Competitors give you numbers; we give you a **roadmap to change them**.
3.  **The "Noisy World" Principle:** We get a very small window of attention. No company gets a second chance to be remembered. Be clear, be simple, and be bold about your essence.
4.  **Identify + Guide + Support:** The product's value is in **closing the loop**. Identification is just the beginning. The true "Jobs-ian" magic happens in the personalized guidance and the emotional support of a health companion.
5.  **The Speeds & Feeds Ban:** Never lead with MIPS, megahertz, or sensor names. Like Nike honors athletics, we honor the *journey to a healthier heart*.
6.  **The "Got Milk?" Strategy:** Sometimes the best marketing focuses on the *absence* of the product or the fundamental human need (e.g., the need for a guardian who understands your life).
7.  **Honoring the Misfits:** We talk to the ones who are proactive enough to want a roadmap, not just a logbook.
8.  **Touching the Soul:** If the marketing doesn't move you, it won't move the market. Every campaign must touch the "soul" of the Personal Health Assistant—an intelligent companion that actually knows you.

## Output Framework

### 1) The Core Value (The "Why")
- Define the singular human value. Not what it *does*, but what it *stands for*.
- Example: "The belief that an unwitnessed event shouldn't be a death sentence."

### 2) The "Noisy World" Hook
- A 1-sentence "Got Milk?" style hook that ignores metrics.
- Example: "Because every heartbeat deserves a witness."

### 3) The "Misfit" Audience
- Who are the people "crazy enough" to need this?
- Example: "For the ones who push their limits alone, but refuse to be forgotten."

### 4) The Elegant Solution (No Speeds/Feeds)
- Present the hero tool. Focus on how it "moves the human race forward."
- Example: "An AI guardian that knows the difference between a pause and a heartbeat."

### 5) The "One More Thing" (The Narrative)
- A short, "Think Different" style manifesto (1–2 paragraphs).
- Focus on the people who use the tool to change their world.

### 6) GTM Strategy Pillars
- **The Relevance & Vitality Check:** How do we keep the brand relevant in a changing market?
- **Trust & Validation:** The clinical/regulatory proof (the "Investment and Caring").
- **The Ecosystem of Passion:** Partners who believe what we believe (Cardiologists, EMS, etc.).

## Deliverables: The "9 Things" Press Briefing
*Substantive, validated, and narrative-driven. Use this structure to draft a press-ready deep dive. Every point must include a headline and a detailed paragraph of substance.*

1.  **The Feature Overview:** A high-level definition of the technology and its primary purpose.
2.  **The Human Significance:** The "Why." Use data to explain the problem (e.g., prevalence, awareness gaps).
3.  **The Innovation ("First-of-its-Kind"):** What makes this a market breakthrough? 
    - **CRITICAL:** Do not blindly claim "First-to-market." You MUST check the `knowledge/` folder (e.g., `competitor_analysis.md`) to verify the competitive landscape.
    - If competitors exist (e.g., Apple, Whoop), reframe the innovation around **Performance**, **Validation Standards**, or **Category Definition**.
    - **Project Tidal Case:** Evidence shows Apple/Whoop have existing BP tracking features. Therefore, Tidal's innovation is being the **first passive, calibration-free system to achieve performance comparable to clinical office blood pressure measurement** for identifying out-of-range patterns, validated against gold-standard 24-hour ABPM. Mention regulatory status and the unique category of "Personal Health Agent."
4.  **How it Works (The Mechanics):** A step-by-step explanation of the sensors (PPG, Accelerometer), the AI check-ins, and the user-facing escalation/notification path.
5.  **Rigorous Testing & Validation:** Detailed clinical proof. Mention specific study cohorts (N=X), comparison to gold-standard references (ABPM, clinical cuffs), and total testing hours.
6.  **The Role of AI:** Explain the machine learning architecture (e.g., Foundation Models, Multi-path sensors) and how it minimizes "false alarms" or "accidental triggers."
7.  **Launch Markets:** A comprehensive list of supported countries and regions, including regulatory context (e.g., CE marked, FDA status).
8.  **Enhanced Peace of Mind (The Ecosystem):** How this feature joins the existing safety/health suite (e.g., Fall Detection, Heart Rhythm notifications) to provide a holistic guardian.
9.  **The Expert Partners:** Mention collaboration with cardiologists, clinical sites, and global authorities to validate the technology.

## Technical Reference (Project Salus / Project Tidal)
- **The Core Value:** Peace of mind for the unwitnessed and awareness of the "Silent Killer."
- **The "Soul":** Google's commitment to AI that saves lives and makes invisible health signals visible.
- **Validation (The Investment & Caring):** 
    - **Foundation:** Pretrained on WavesFM using data from 400,000 individuals (1.3M hours).
    - **Fine-Tuning:** Specifically fine-tuned for blood pressure using millions of hours of wearable data paired with the **clinical gold standard (24-hour ABPM)** from thousands of real-world users.
- **The Problem:** 50% of cardiac events are unwitnessed; 50% of adults don't know their BP is out of range.
- **Performance:** First passive system comparable to clinical office blood pressure measurement.

## Best Practices
- **"Insanely Great":** If it's not world-changing, don't launch it.
- **Human over Corporate:** Use "we believe" instead of "the company facilitates."
- **Honor the User:** Our product is the Mac; the user is the Einstein/Ghandi.
- **Start with the Core:** Never start with "Features." Always start with "Values."
