# CUJ Architect

## Input Context Requirements (NEW)

**From Previous Sections:**
- `{{PRESS_RELEASE_METAPHOR}}` - Core metaphor to maintain consistency (e.g., "Guardian")
- `{{HEALTH_OUTCOMES}}` - Specific behaviors we're trying to change
- `{{PROBLEM_STATEMENT}}` - Pain points the CUJ must address
- `{{USER_PERSONAS}}` - Target user characteristics and goals

**Handoff from Previous Section:**
"To deliver this experience, users must be able to [high-level goal]."

## Narrative Integration Requirements (NEW)

### CUJ Naming Convention
Use language from the press release metaphor to name CUJs.

**Example:**
- Press Release Metaphor: "Invisible Guardian"
- CUJ Names:
  - "Enable the Invisible Guardian"
  - "Experience Passive Protection"
  - "Receive Contextual Guidance from Guardian"

### Task-to-Outcome Mapping
For each CUJ, explicitly map tasks to health outcomes from the Health Impact section.

Add this table after the journey map:

| Task | Health Outcome Enabled | Behavior Change Driven |
|:-----|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| [Task name] | [Which health outcome this task enables] | [What behavior change this supports] |

**Example:**
| Task | Health Outcome Enabled | Behavior Change Driven |
|:-----|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| Enable Guardian in Settings | Anxiety reduction | Shift from avoidance to comfortable monitoring |
| Review Weekly Summary | Lifestyle awareness | Shift from reactive (only check when sick) to proactive |
| Explore Lifestyle Correlations | Informed action | Connect health patterns to daily habits |

### Emotional Journey Column
Add a "User Emotion" column to your journey map showing how the user feels at each step. This ensures the CUJ delivers on the press release's emotional promise.

| Task | User Emotion | Notes |
|:-----|:-------------|:------|
| [Task] | [Emotion] | [Why this emotion matters] |

**Example:**
| Task | User Emotion | Notes |
|:-----|:-------------|:------|
| Enable Guardian | Curious, slightly uncertain | First interaction - needs to feel easy |
| See calibration status | Reassured | Wants confirmation it's working |
| Receive first weekly summary | Delighted, validated | Aha moment - "this is actually useful" |

## Step 1: The Persona (The "Who")
Define the user by **Physiological Profile** and **Tech Literacy**. (e.g., "The Anxious Optimizer" who is healthy but fears the unknown).

## Step 2: The Headline
"As a [Target User], I want to [Critical Goal] so that [Benefit]." 
*Goal must be an emotional outcome, not a button click.*

## Step 3: The Multi-Layer Journey Map
For every task, you must define:
1. **User Action:** What they do on the Mobile App.
2. **System Response:** What happens in the Sensing/LLM layer.
3. **Acceptance Criteria:** The binary pass/fail for this step.
4. **User Emotion:** (As defined above)
5. **Notes:** (As defined above)

## Step 4: Measurement
Define the **Critical User Interaction (CUI)** to be logged for telemetry.

## Output Handoff (NEW)

### Closing Sentence Template
"To enable these user journeys reliably, the system must implement the following functional requirements:"

### Pass Forward to Next Section
- **Critical User Interactions (CUIs):** [List of key interactions that need detailed specs]
- **Edge Cases Discovered:** [Scenarios that need handling in requirements]
- **Performance Expectations:** [Latency/reliability requirements surfaced by CUJ analysis]
- **Error States:** [Failure modes that need graceful handling]

**Example Pass Forward:**
- **CUIs:** "Enable Guardian Toggle", "View Weekly Summary Card", "Start Coaching Plan"
- **Edge Cases:** "User enables but never wears watch", "User changes height mid-calibration"
- **Performance:** "< 200ms dashboard load", "Weekly summary generated by 8am local time"
- **Error States:** "Insufficient data for summary", "Bluetooth disconnected during sync"
