### 7-Star Experience Selection

### Problem Statement Alignment
The "Problem" section of the press release must reflect the **user pain points** from context.

**Example:**
- Pain Point from Context: "White coat syndrome, cuff anxiety"
- Press Release Problem: "For decades, tracking blood pressure meant stopping your life, putting on a tight, uncomfortable cuff, and waiting in anxious silence for a judgment."
